.TH MKFIFO 1M "Jun 24, 2020"
.SH NAME
mkfifo \- make FIFO special file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/mkfifo\fR [\fB-m\fR \fImode\fR] \fIfile\fR...
.fi

.SS "ksh93"
.nf
mkfifo [ \fIoptions\fR ] \fIfile\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS "/usr/bin/mkfifo"
The \fBmkfifo\fR utility creates the \fBFIFO\fR special files named by its
argument list. The arguments are taken sequentially, in the order specified;
and each \fBFIFO\fR special file is either created completely or, in the case
of an error or signal, not created at all.
.sp
.LP
If errors are encountered in creating one of the special files, \fBmkfifo\fR
writes a diagnostic message to standard error and continues with the
remaining arguments, if any.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmkfifo\fR utility calls the library routine \fBmkfifo\fR(3C), with a
\fIpath\fR argument equivalent to the \fIfile\fR argument from the command line,
and \fImode\fR is set to the equivalent of \fBa=rw\fR, modified by the current
value of the file mode creation mask \fBumask\fR(1).
.SS "ksh93"
The \fBmkfifo\fR utility creates one or more \fBFIFO\fRs. By default, the mode
of the created FIFO is \fBa=rw\fR minus the bits set in \fBumask\fR(1).
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "/usr/bin/mkfifo"
The following option is supported for \fB/usr/bin/mkfifo\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR \fImode\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 11n
Set the file permission bits of the newly-created \fBFIFO\fR to the specified
\fImode\fR value. The \fImode\fR option-argument will be the same as the
\fImode\fR operand defined for the \fBchmod\fR(1) command. For a
symbolic mode option-argument, the \fIop\fR characters \fB+\fR and \fB\(mi\fR
will be interpreted relative to an assumed initial mode of \fBa=rw\fR.
.RE

.SS "ksh93"
The following option is supported for \fBksh93\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR \fImode\fR\fR
.ad
.br
.na
\fB\fB--mode=\fR\fImode\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 15n
Set the mode of the created FIFO to \fImode\fR. The \fImode\fR option-argument
is a symbolic or octal mode as in \fBchmod\fR(1). Relative modes assume an
initial mode of \fBa=rw\fR.
.RE

.SH OPERANDS
The following operand is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
A path name of the \fBFIFO\fR special file to be created.
.RE

.SH USAGE
See \fBlargefile\fR(5) for the description of the behavior of \fBmkfifo\fR when
encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes).
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
that affect the execution of \fBmkfifo\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR,
\fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
All the specified \fBFIFO\fR special files were created successfully.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB>0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
An error occurred.
.RE
