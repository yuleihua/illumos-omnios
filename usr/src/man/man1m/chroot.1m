.Sh NAME
.Nm chroot
.Nd change root directory for a command
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar newroot
.Ar command
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility causes
.Ar command
to be executed relative to
.Ar newroot .
The meaning of any initial slash
.Pq /
in the path names is changed to
.Ar newroot
for
.Ar command
and any of its child processes.
Upon execution, the initial working directory is
.Ar newroot .
.Pp
Notice that redirecting the output of
.Ar command
to a file, such as in:
.Pp
.D1 Nm chroot Ar newroot Ar command Sy > Pa xyz
.Pp
will create the file
.Pa xyz
relative to the original root of
.Ar command ,
not the new one.
.Pp
The new root path name is always relative to the current root.
Even if a
.Nm
is currently in effect, the
.Ar newroot
argument is relative to the current root of the running process.
.Pp
This command can be run only by the super-user.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The exit status of
.Nm
is the exit status of
.Ar command .
.Sh OPERANDS
The following operands are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Ar newroot
The new root directory.
.It Ar command
The command to be executed relative to
.Ar newroot .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Sy Example 1
Using the
.Nm
Utility
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility provides an easy way to extract
.Sy tar
files
.Pq see Xr tar 1
written with absolute filenames to a different location.
It is necessary to copy the shared libraries used by
.Sy tar
.Pq see Xr ldd 1
to the
.Ar newroot
filesystem.

.Sh NOTES
Exercise extreme caution when referencing device files in the new root file
system.
.Pp
References by routines such as
.Xr ttyname 3C
to
.Dv stdin ,
.Dv stdout ,
and
.Dv stderr
will find that the device associated with the file descriptor is unknown after
.Nm
is run.
