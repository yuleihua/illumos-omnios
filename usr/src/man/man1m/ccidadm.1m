.Sh NAME
.Nm ccidadm
.Nd CCID administration utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Cm list
.Nm
.Cm atr
.Op Fl pvx
.Op Ar device
.Nm
.Cm reader
.Op Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can be used to list the CCID controllers and their slots known to the
.Xr ccid 7D
driver, query the features and capabilities of a CCID controller, and print
the ATR of an ICC (integrated circuit card) that is inserted in a slot on an
CCID controller.
.Pp
The information returned by the hardware is printed by
.Nm
in a human-readable form where applicable.
.Sh ARGUMENTS
.Nm
expects the following kinds of arguments:
.Bl -tag -width "device"
.It Ar command
Any command
.Nm
understands.
See section
.Sx COMMANDS
for more information.
.It Ar device
Specifies a CCID reader or a slot, either as absolute path to the device node
or in a short-hand form.
The short-hand form consists of the reader instance, specified by the driver
name
.Qq ccid
followed by the instance number of the reader, and optionally a slot instance
separated by a
.Qq / ,
consisting of the word
.Qq slot
followed by the slot number.
Here's an example for slot 1 on ccid reader 5:
.Qq ccid5/slot1
.El
.Sh COMMANDS
.Bl -tag -width ""
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm list
.Xc
Lists the CCID controllers and their slots known to the system and prints their
product name, device node, card state, and the transport protocol in use.
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm atr
.Op Fl pvx
.Op Ar device
.Xc
Prints the ATR of an ICC that is inserted in the specified slot.
If a device is specified it must refer to a certain slot.
If no device is specified the command will print the ATR of all inserted slots
in the system.
A human-readable summary of the ATR data is printed when no flags are given.
The following options can be used to alter the output of the
.Cm atr
command:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl v
Verbose output, the individual bytes of the ATR are printed and decoded
in a human-readable form.
Additionally the historic data in the ATR is printed as a hexadecimal dump.
.It Fl x
The complete ATR is printed as a hexadecimal dump.
.El
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm reader
.Op Ar device
.Xc
Print the capabilities of the specified CCID reader.
Specifying slot number is not required but can optionally be specified.
If no device is given, the command will print the capabilities of all attached
CCID readers.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, 1 on any error opening or accessing the device, and
2 if no command or an unknown command are given.
