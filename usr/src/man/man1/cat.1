.TH CAT 1 "Sep 19, 2020"
.SH NAME
cat \- concatenate and display files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SS "\fB/usr/bin/cat\fR"
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/cat\fR [\fB-nbsuvet\fR] [\fIfile\fR...]
.fi

.SS "\fBksh93\fR"
.nf
\fBcat\fR [\fB-bdenstuvABDEST\fR] [\fIfile\fR...]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS "\fB/usr/bin/cat\fR"
The \fBcat\fR utility reads each \fIfile\fR in sequence and writes it on the
standard output. Thus:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBcat file\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
prints \fIfile\fR on your terminal, and:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBcat file1 file2 >file3\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
concatenates \fIfile1\fR and \fIfile2\fR, and writes the results in
\fIfile3\fR. If no input file is given, \fBcat\fR reads from the standard input
file.
.SS "\fBksh93\fR"
The \fBcat\fR built-in in \fBksh93\fR is associated with the \fB/bin\fR and
\fB/usr/bin\fR paths. It is invoked when \fBcat\fR is executed without a
pathname prefix and the pathname search finds a \fB/bin/cat\fR or
\fB/usr/bin/cat\fR executable. \fBcat\fR copies each file in sequence to the
standard output. If no file is specified, or if the file is \fB-\fR, \fBcat\fR
copies from standard input starting at the current location.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "\fB/usr/bin/cat\fR"
The following options are supported by \fB/usr/bin/cat\fR:
.sp
.ne 2
.na

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Precede each line output with its line number.
.RE

.sp

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-v\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Non-printing characters, with the exception of tabs, NEWLINEs and form feeds,
are printed visibly. ASCII control characters (octal \fB000\fR \(mi \fB037\fR)
are printed as \fB^\fR\fIn,\fR where \fIn\fR is the corresponding ASCII
character in the range octal 100 \(mi 137 (@, A, B, C, ..., X, Y, Z, [, \e,
], ^, and _); the \fBDEL\fR character (octal \fB0177\fR) is printed \fB^?\fR.
Other non-printable characters are printed as \fBM-\fR\fIx,\fR where \fIx\fR is
the ASCII character specified by the low-order seven bits.
.RE

.sp
.LP
When used with the \fB-v\fR option, the following options can be used:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
A \fB$\fR character is printed at the end of each line, prior to the NEWLINE.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Tabs are printed as \fB^I\fRs and form feeds to be printed as \fB^L\fRs.
.RE

.sp
.LP

\fB\fB-v\fR \fB--show-nonprinting\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
Cause non-printing characters (with the exception of TABs, NEWLINEs, and form
feeds) to be output as printable character sequences. \fBASCII\fR control
characters are printed as \fB^n\fR, where \fIn\fR is the corresponding
\fBASCII\fR character in the range octal \fB100\fR-\fB137\fR. The DEL character
(octal \fB0177\fR) is copied as \fB^?\fR. Other non-printable characters are
copied as \fBM-\fR\fIx\fR where \fIx\fR is the \fBASCII\fR character specified
by the low-order seven bits. Multi-byte characters in the current locale are
treated as printable characters.

.SH OPERANDS
The following operand is supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIfile\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 8n
A path name of an input file. If no \fIfile\fR is specified, the standard input
is used. If \fIfile\fR is \fB\|\(mi\|\fR, \fBcat\fR reads from the standard
input at that point in the sequence. \fBcat\fR does not close and reopen
standard input when it is referenced in this way, but accepts multiple
occurrences of \fB\|\(mi\|\fR as \fIfile\fR.
.RE

.SH USAGE
See \fBlargefile\fR(5) for the description of the behavior of \fBcat\fR when
encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes).
.SH EXAMPLES
\fBExample 1 \fRConcatenating a File
.sp
.LP
The following command writes the contents of the file \fBmyfile\fR to standard
output:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBcat myfile\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 2 \fRConcatenating Two files into One
.sp
.LP
The following command concatenates the files \fBdoc1\fR and \fBdoc2\fR and
writes the result to \fBdoc.all\fR.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBcat doc1 doc2 > doc.all\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.LP
\fBExample 3 \fRConcatenating Two Arbitrary Pieces of Input with a Single
Invocation
.sp
.LP
When standard input is a terminal, the following command gets two arbitrary
pieces of input from the terminal with a single invocation of \fBcat\fR:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBcat start - middle - end > file\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
If standard input is a regular file,

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBcat start - middle - end > file\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
would be equivalent to the following command:

.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBcat start - middle /dev/null end > file\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
because the entire contents of the file would be consumed by \fBcat\fR the
first time \fB\|\(mi\|\fR was used as a \fIfile\fR operand and an end-of-file
condition would be detected immediately when \fB\|\(mi\|\fR was referenced the
second time.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
See \fBenviron\fR(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
that affect the execution of \fBcat\fR: \fBLANG\fR, \fBLC_ALL\fR,
\fBLC_CTYPE\fR, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fR, and \fBNLSPATH\fR.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
All input files were output successfully.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB>0\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
An error occurred.
.RE

Interface Stability	See below.

.LP
The \fBksh93\fR built-in binding to \fB/bin\fR and \fB/usr/bin\fR is Volatile.
The built-in interfaces are Uncommitted.
.SH SEE ALSO

\fBstandards\fR(5)
.SH NOTES
Redirecting the output of \fBcat\fR onto one of the files being read causes the
loss of the data originally in the file being read. For example,
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBcat filename1 filename2 > filename1\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
causes the original data in \fBfilename1\fR to be lost.
