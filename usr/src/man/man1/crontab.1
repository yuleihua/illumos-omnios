.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBcrontab\fR utility manages a user's access with \fBcron\fR (see
\fBcron\fR(1M)) by copying, creating, listing, and removing \fBcrontab\fR
files. If invoked without options, \fBcrontab\fR copies the specified file, or
the standard input if no file is specified, into a directory that holds all
users' crontabs.
.sp
.LP
If \fBcrontab\fR is invoked with \fIfilename\fR, this overwrites an existing
\fBcrontab\fR entry for the user that invokes it, or for the user specified
with the \fB-u\fR option.
.SS "\fBcrontab\fR Access Control"

if Auditing is enabled, the user's shell is not audited and the user is
not the \fBcrontab\fR owner. This can occur if the user logs in by way of a
program, such as some versions of \fBSSH\fR, which does not set audit
parameters.
.RE
.sp
.LP
The rules for \fBallow\fR and \fBdeny\fR apply to \fBroot\fR only if the
\fBallow\fR/\fBdeny\fR files exist.
.sp
.LP
The \fBallow\fR/\fBdeny\fR files consist of one user name per line.
.SS "\fBcrontab\fR Entry Format"
A \fBcrontab\fR file consists of lines of six fields each. The fields are
separated by spaces or tabs. The first five are integer patterns that specify
the following:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
minute (0\(mi59),
hour (0\(mi23),
day of the month (1\(mi31),
month of the year (1\(mi12),
day of the week (0\(mi6 with 0=Sunday).
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Each of these patterns can be either an asterisk (meaning all legal values) or
a list of elements separated by commas. An element is either a number or two
numbers separated by a hyphen (meaning an inclusive range).
.LP
A range or asterisk can optionally be followed by a step value as
\fI/<number>\fR. For example, \fI2\(mi59/3\fR can be used in the minutes field
to specify every three minutes starting at 2 past the hour, or \fI*/2\fR in
the hours field means every two hours.
.LP
Time specified here is interpreted in the currently active timezone. At the top
of the crontab file this is the timezone which is set system-wide in
/etc/default/init. A user can add a line such as:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
TZ=\fItimezone\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\&...and all subsequent entries will be interpreted using that timezone, until
a new \fBTZ=\fR\fItimezone\fR line is encountered. The specification of days
can be made by two fields (day of the month and day of the week). Both are
adhered to if specified as a list of elements. See \fBEXAMPLES\fR.
.sp
.LP
The sixth field of a line in a \fBcrontab\fR file is a string that is executed
by the shell at the specified times. A percent character in this field (unless
escaped by \fB\e\fR\|) is translated to a \fINEWLINE\fR character.
.sp
.LP
Only the first line (up to a \fB`\|%\|'\fR or end of line) of the command field
is executed by the shell. Other lines are made available to the command as
standard input. Any blank line or line beginning with a \fB`\|#\|'\fR is a
comment and is ignored.
.sp
.LP
The shell is invoked from your $HOME directory. As with $TZ, both $SHELL and
$HOME can be set by having a line such as:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
SHELL=/usr/bin/\fIsomeshell\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\&...or:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
HOME=\fIsomedirectory\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
\&...which will take precedence for all the remaining entries in the
\fBcrontab\fR or until there is another \fBHOME\fR or \fBSHELL\fR entry. It is
invoked with an \fBarg0\fR of the basename of the $SHELL that is currently in
effect. A user who wants to have his \fB\&.profile\fR or equivalent file
executed must  explicitly do so in the \fBcrontab\fR file. \fBcron\fR supplies
a default environment for every shell, defining HOME, LOGNAME, SHELL, TZ, and
PATH. The default PATH for user \fBcron\fR jobs is \fB/usr/bin\fR; while root
\fBcron\fR jobs default to \fB/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\fR. The default PATH can be
set in \fB/etc/default/cron\fR (see \fBcron\fR(1M)). The TZ, HOME, and SHELL
environment variables are set to match those that are in effect in the
\fBcrontab\fR file at the time.
.sp
.LP
If you do not redirect the standard output and standard error of your commands,
any generated output or errors are mailed to you.
.SS "\fBcrontab\fR Environment Variables"
The following variables are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBHOME\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Allows the user to choose an alternative directory for cron to change
directory to prior to running the command. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
HOME=/var/tmp
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBSHELL\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The name of the shell to use to run subsequent commands. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
SHELL=/usr/bin/ksh
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBTZ\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Allows the user to choose the timezone in which the \fBcron\fR entries are run.
This effects both the environment of the command that is run and the timing of
the entry. For example, to have your entries run using the timezone for
Iceland, use:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
TZ=Iceland
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.RE

.sp
.LP
Each of these variables affects all of the lines that follow it in the
\fBcrontab\fR file, until it is reset by a subsequent line resetting that
variable. Hence, it is possible to have multiple timezones supported within a
single \fBcrontab\fR file.
.sp
.LP
The lines that are not setting these environment variables are  the same as
crontab entries that conform to the UNIX standard and are described elsewhere
in this man page.
.SS "Setting \fBcron\fR Jobs Across Timezones"
The default timezone of the \fBcron\fR daemon sets the system-wide timezone for
\fBcron\fR entries. This, in turn, is by set by default system-wide using
\fB/etc/default/init\fR.
.sp
.LP
If some form of \fBdaylight savings\fR or \fBsummer/winter time\fR is in
effect, then jobs scheduled during the switchover period could be executed
once, twice, or not at all.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB-e\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Edits a copy of the current user's \fBcrontab\fR file, or creates an empty file
to edit if \fBcrontab\fR does not exist. When editing is complete, the file is
installed as the user's \fBcrontab\fR file.
.sp
The environment variable \fBEDITOR\fR determines which editor is invoked with
the \fB-e\fR option. All \fBcrontab\fR jobs should be submitted using
\fBcrontab\fR. Do not add jobs by just editing the \fBcrontab\fR file, because
\fBcron\fR is not aware of changes made this way.
.sp
If all lines in the \fBcrontab\fR file are deleted, the old \fBcrontab\fR file
is restored. The correct way to delete all lines is to remove the \fBcrontab\fR
file using the \fB-r\fR option.
.sp
If \fIusername\fR is specified, the specified user's \fBcrontab\fR file is
edited, rather than the current user's \fBcrontab\fR file. This can only be
done by root or by a user with the \fBsolaris.jobs.admin\fR authorization.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB-l\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Lists the \fBcrontab\fR file for the invoking user. Only root or a user with
the \fBsolaris.jobs.admin\fR authorization can specify a username following the
\fB-l\fR option to list the \fBcrontab\fR file of the specified user.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB-r\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Removes a user's \fBcrontab\fR from the \fBcrontab\fR directory. Only root or a
user with the \fBsolaris.jobs.admin\fR authorization can specify a username
following the \fB-r\fR option to remove the \fBcrontab\fR file of the specified
user.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB-u\fR \fIusername\fR
.ad
.RS 6n
Specifies the name of the user whose \fBcrontab\fR is to be replaced, viewed or
modified. This can only be done by root or by a user with the
\fBsolaris.jobs.admin\fR authorization.

.sp

.LP
\fBExample 5 \fRUsing Environment Variables
.sp
.LP
The following entries take advantage of \fBcrontab\fR support for certain
environment variables.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
TZ=GMT
HOME=/local/home/user
SHELL=/usr/bin/ksh
0 0 * * * echo $(date) >        midnight.GMT
TZ=PST
0 0 * * * echo $(date) >        midnight.PST
TZ=EST
HOME=/local/home/myuser
SHELL=/bin/csh
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The preceding entries allow two jobs to run. The first one would run at
midnight in the GMT timezone and the second would run at midnight in the PST
timezone. Both would be run in the directory \fB/local/home/user\fR using the
Korn shell. The file concludes with \fBTZ\fR, \fBHOME\fR, and \fBSHELL\fR
entries that return those variable to their default values.

.SH NOTES
If you inadvertently enter the \fBcrontab\fR command with no arguments, do not
attempt to get out with Control-d. This removes all entries in your
\fBcrontab\fR file. Instead, exit with Control-c.
.sp
.LP
When updating \fBcron\fR, check first for existing \fBcrontab\fR entries that
can be scheduled close to the time of the update. Such entries can be lost if
the update process completes after the scheduled event. This can happen
because, when \fBcron\fR is notified by \fBcrontab\fR to update the internal
view of a user's \fBcrontab\fR file, it first removes the user's existing
internal \fBcrontab\fR and any internal scheduled events. Then it reads the new
\fBcrontab\fR file and rebuilds the internal \fBcrontab\fR and events. This
last step takes time, especially with a large \fBcrontab\fR file, and can
complete \fBafter\fR an existing \fBcrontab\fR entry is scheduled to run if it
is scheduled too close to the update. To be safe, start a new job at least 60
seconds after the current date and time.
.sp
.LP
If an authorized user other than root modifies another user's \fBcrontab\fR
file, the resulting behavior can be unpredictable. Instead, the authorized user
should first use \fBsu\fR(1M) to become superuser to the other user's login
before making any changes to the \fBcrontab\fR file.
.sp
.LP
Care should be taken when adding \fBTZ\fR, \fBSHELL\fR and \fBHOME\fR variables
to the \fBcrontab\fR  file when the \fBcrontab\fR file could be shared with
applications that do not expect those variables to be changed from the default.
Resetting the values to their defaults at the bottom of the file will minimize
the risk of problems.
