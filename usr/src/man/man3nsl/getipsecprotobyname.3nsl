.SH DESCRIPTION
Use the \fBgetipsecprotobyname()\fR and \fBgetipsecprotobynum()\fR functions to
obtain the IPsec algorithm mappings that are defined by \fBipsecalgs\fR(1M).
You can also use the \fBgetipsecprotobyname()\fR and \fBgetipsecprotobynum()\fR
functions in conjunction with \fBgetipsecalgbyname\fR(3NSL) and
\fBgetipsecalgbynum\fR(3NSL) to obtain information about the supported IPsec
algorithms. The IPsec algorithms and associated protocol name spaces are
defined by \fIRFC 2407\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBgetipsecprotobyname()\fR takes as an argument the name of an IPsec protocol
and returns its assigned protocol number. The character string returned by the
\fBgetipsecprotobyname()\fR function must be freed by the called when it is no
longer needed.
.sp
.LP
\fBgetipsecprotobynum()\fR takes as an argument a protocol number and returns
the corresponding protocol name.
.sp
.LP
The following protocol numbers are pre-defined:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBIPSEC_PROTO_ESP\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
Defines the encryption algorithms (transforms) that can be used by IPsec to
provide data confidentiality.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBIPSEC_PROTO_AH\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 19n
Defines the authentication algorithms (transforms) that can be used by IPsec to
provide authentication.
.RE

.SH PARAMETERS
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIproto_name\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
A pointer to the name of an IPsec protocol.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIproto_num\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
A pointer to a protocol number.
.RE

.SH RETURN VALUES
The \fBgetipsecprotobyname()\fR function returns a protocol number upon
success, or \fB-1\fR if the protocol specified does not exist.
.sp
.LP
 The \fBgetipsecprotobynum()\fR function returns a protocol name upon success,
or the \fINULL\fR value if the protocol number specified does not exist.
