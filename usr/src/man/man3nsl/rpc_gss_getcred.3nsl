.TH RPC_GSS_GETCRED 3NSL "September 22, 2020"
.SH NAME
rpc_gss_getcred \- get credentials of client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <rpc/rpcsec_gss.h>

\fBbool_t\fR \fBrpc_gss_getcred\fR(\fBstruct svc_req\fR \fI*req\fR, \fBrpc_gss_rawcred_t\fR \fI**rcred\fR,
     \fBrpc_gss_ucred\fR \fI**ucred\fR, \fBvoid\fR \fI**cookie\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrpc_gss_getcred()\fR is used by a server to fetch the credentials of a
client.  These credentials may either be network credentials (in the form of a
\fBrpc_gss_rawcred_t\fR structure) or UNIX credentials.
.sp
.LP
For more information on \fBRPCSEC_GSS\fR data types, see the
\fBrpcsec_gss\fR(3NSL) man page.
.SH PARAMETERS
Essentially,  \fBrpc_gss_getcred()\fR passes a pointer to a request
(\fBsvc_req\fR) as well as pointers to two credential structures and a
user-defined cookie; if \fBrpc_gss_getcred()\fR is successful, at least one
credential structure is "filled out" with values, as is, optionally, the
cookie.
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIreq\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
Pointer to the received service request.   \fBsvc_req\fR is an RPC structure
containing information on the context of an RPC invocation, such as program,
version, and transport information.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIrcred\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
A pointer to an \fBrpc_gss_rawcred_t\fR structure pointer. This structure
contains the version number of the \fBRPCSEC_GSS\fR protocol being used; the
security mechanism and QOPs for this session (as strings); principal names for
the client (as a \fBrpc_gss_principal_t\fR structure) and server (as a string);
and the security service (integrity, privacy, etc., as an enum).  If an
application is not interested in these values, it may pass \fINULL\fR for this
parameter.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIucred\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
The caller's UNIX credentials, in the form of a pointer to a pointer to a
\fBrpc_gss_ucred_t\fR structure, which includes the client's uid and gids.  If
an application is not interested in these values, it may pass \fINULL\fR for
this parameter.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fIcookie\fR \fR
.ad
.RS 11n
A four-byte quantity that an application may use in any manner it wants to; RPC
does not interpret it.  (For example, a cookie may be a pointer or index to a
structure that represents a context initiator.) See also
\fBrpc_gss_set_callback\fR(3NSL).
.RE

.SH RETURN VALUES
\fBrpc_gss_getcred()\fR returns  TRUE if it is successful; otherwise, use
\fBrpc_gss_get_error()\fR to get the error associated with the failure.
