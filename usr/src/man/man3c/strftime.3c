.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBstrftime()\fR, \fBstrftime_l()\fR, \fBascftime()\fR, and \fBcftime()\fR
functions place
bytes into the array pointed to by \fIs\fR as controlled by the string pointed
to by \fIformat\fR. The \fIformat\fR string consists of zero or more conversion
specifications and ordinary characters.  A conversion specification consists of
a '\fB%\fR' (percent) character and one or two terminating conversion
characters that determine the conversion specification's behavior.  All
ordinary characters (including the terminating null byte) are copied unchanged
into the array pointed to by \fIs\fR. If copying takes place between objects
that overlap, the behavior is undefined. For \fBstrftime()\fR, no more than
\fImaxsize\fR bytes are placed into the array. The \fBstrftime_l()\fR function
behaves identically to \fBstrftime()\fR function, but instead of operating in
the current locale, it operates in the locale specified by \fIloc\fR.
.LP
If \fIformat\fR is \fBNULL\fR, then the locale's default format is used.
For \fBstrftime()\fR the default format is the same as \fB%c\fR; for
\fBcftime()\fR and \fBascftime()\fR the default format is the same as \fB%+\fR.
\fBcftime()\fR and \fBascftime()\fR first try to use the value of the
environment variable \fBCFTIME\fR, and if that is undefined or empty, the
default format is used.
.LP
Each conversion specification is replaced by appropriate characters as
described in the following list. The appropriate characters are determined by
the \fBLC_TIME\fR category of the program's locale and by the values contained
in the structure pointed to by \fItimeptr\fR for \fBstrftime()\fR and
\fBascftime()\fR, and by the time represented by \fIclock\fR for
\fBcftime()\fR.

If a conversion specification does not correspond to any of the above or to any

undefined and \fB0\fR is returned.
.LP
The difference between \fB%U\fR and \fB%W\fR (and also between modified
conversion specifications \fB%OU\fR and \fB%OW\fR) lies in which day is counted
as the first of the week. Week number 1 is the first week in January starting
with a Sunday for \fB%U\fR or a Monday for \fB%W\fR. Week number 0 contains
those days before the first Sunday or Monday in January for \fB%U\fR and
\fB%W\fR, respectively.
.SS "Modified Conversion Specifications"
Some conversion specifications can be modified by the \fBE\fR and \fBO\fR
modifiers to indicate that an alternate format or specification should be used
rather than the one normally used by the unmodified conversion specification.
If the alternate format or specification does not exist in the current locale,
the behavior will be as if the unmodified specification were used.

.SS "Selecting the Output Language"
These routines produce output that is formatted according to the \fBLC_TIME\fR
locale category.  They use either the current locale, or in the case of
\fBstrftime_l()\fR, the locale supplied by \fIloc\fR.
.SS "Time Zone"
Local time zone information is used as though \fBtzset\fR(3C) were called.
.SH RETURN VALUES
These functions return the
number of characters placed into the array pointed to by \fIs\fR, not including
the terminating null character. If the total number of resulting characters
including the terminating null character is more than \fImaxsize\fR,
\fBstrftime()\fR returns \fB0\fR and the contents of the array are
indeterminate.
.SH EXAMPLES

The following example illustrates the use of \fBstrftime()\fR for the
\fBPOSIX\fR locale. It shows what the string in \fIstr\fR would look like if
the structure pointed to by \fItmptr\fR contains the values corresponding to
Thursday, August 28, 1986 at 12:44:36.

.SH NOTES
The conversion specification for \fB%V\fR was changed in the Solaris 7 release.
This change was based on the public review draft of the ISO C9x standard at
that time. Previously, the specification stated that if the week containing 1
January had fewer than four days in the new year, it became week 53 of the
previous year. The ISO C9x standard committee subsequently recognized that that
specification had been incorrect.
.LP
The conversion specifications for \fB%g\fR, \fB%G\fR, \fB%Eg\fR, \fB%EG\fR, and
\fB%Og\fR were added in the Solaris 7 release.  This change was based on the
public review draft of the ISO C9x standard at that time. The \fB%g\fR and
\fB%G\fR specifications were adopted in the formal standard.  The other two
were not, and should not be used in portable applications.
.LP
The conversion specification for \fB%u\fR was changed in the Solaris 8 release.
This change was based on the XPG4 specification.
.LP
If using the \fB%Z\fR specifier and \fBzoneinfo\fR timezones and if the input
date is outside the range 20:45:52 UTC, December  13, 1901 to 03:14:07 UTC,
January 19, 2038, the timezone name may not be correct.
.LP
The conversion specification for \fB%+\fR was added in illumos.
It is not part of any standard, although it is available on a number
of other platforms.
Its use is discouraged for conforming applications.
