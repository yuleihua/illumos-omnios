.SH NAME
wcscoll, wcscoll_l, wscoll \- wide character string comparison using collating information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <wchar.h>

\fBint\fR \fBwcscoll\fR(\fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fIws1\fR, \fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fIws2\fR);
.fi
.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBwcscoll_l\fR(\fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fIws1\fR, \fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fIws2\fR, \fBlocale_t\fR \fIloc\fR);
.fi
.LP
.nf
\fBint\fR \fBwscoll\fR(\fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fIws1\fR, \fBconst wchar_t *\fR\fIws2\fR);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBwcscoll()\fR, \fBwcscoll_l()\fR, and \fBwscoll()\fR functions compare
the wide character
string pointed to by \fIws1\fR to the wide character string pointed to by
\fIws2\fR, both interpreted as appropriate to the \fBLC_COLLATE\fR locale
category.
.LP
These  functions do not change the setting of \fBerrno\fR if successful.
.LP
An application wanting to check for error situations should set \fBerrno\fR to
0 before calling these functions.  If \fBerrno\fR is non-zero
on return, an error has occurred.
.LP
The function \fBwcsoll_l()\fR behaves identically to \fBwcsoll\fR(), except
instead of operating in the current locale, it operates in the locale
specified by \fIloc\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, these functions return an
integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, depending upon whether the wide
character string pointed to by \fIws1\fR is greater than, equal to, or less
than the wide character string pointed to by \fIws2\fR, when both are
interpreted as appropriate to the current locale, or the locale
specified by \fIloc\fR. On error,
they set \fBerrno\fR, but no return value is reserved to indicate an error.
.SH ERRORS
The \fBwcscoll()\fR, \fBwcscoll_l()\fR and \fBwscoll()\fR functions may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBEINVAL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 10n
The \fIws1\fR or \fIws2\fR arguments contain wide character codes outside the
domain of the collating sequence.
.RE
.SH USAGE
The \fBwcsxfrm\fR(3C) and \fBwcscmp\fR(3C) functions should be used for sorting
large lists, or when performing many comparisons on the same strings.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
See \fBattributes\fR(5) for descriptions of the following attributes:

The \fBwcscoll()\fR and \fBwcscoll_l()\fR functions are Standard.
The \fBwscoll()\fR function is Committed.
