.Sh NAME
.Nm closedir
.Nd close a directory stream
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In dirent.h
.Ft int
.Fo closedir
.Fa "DIR *dirp"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn closedir
function closes the directory stream referred to by the argument
.Fa dirp ,
which generally came from calling
.Xr opendir 3C
or
.Xr fdopendir 3C .
Upon return, the value of
.Fa dirp
will no longer point to an accessible object of the type
.Ft DIR .
The underlying file descriptor for the directory stream will be closed.
This includes a
.Ft DIR
created by passing a file descriptor to
.Xr fdopendir 3C .
.Pp
When the directory stream is closed, any memory that is associated with
the stream will no longer be valid.
Most notably, the dirent structures returned from
.Xr readdir 3C
use memory associated with the corresponding
.Ft "DIR *"
argument.
Each directory stream has its own independent memory.
Closing one stream does not impact the validity of other streams.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn closedir
function returns
.Sy 0 .
Otherwise,
.Sy -1
is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn closedir
function may fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Er EBADF
The
.Fa dirp
argument does not refer to an open directory stream.
.It Er EINTR
The
.Fn closedir
function was interrupted by a signal.
