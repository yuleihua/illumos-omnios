.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Vt timeval
and
.Vt timespec
structures are declared in the
.In time.h
and
.In sys/time.h
headers respectively:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
typedef struct timespec {
	time_t		tv_sec;		/* seconds */
	long		tv_nsec;	/* and nanoseconds */
} timespec_t;

struct timeval {
	time_t		tv_sec;		/* seconds */
	suseconds_t	tv_usec;	/* and microseconds */
};
.Ed
.Pp
In both cases, the
.Fa tv_sec
member represents elapsed time in whole seconds.
The
.Fa tv_nsec
and
.Fa tv_usec
members represent the rest of the elapsed time in nanoseconds and
microseconds respectively, depending on the structure.
.Pp
The
.Dv TIMEVAL_TO_TIMESPEC
macro can be used to convert a
.Vt struct timeval
structure to a
.Vt struct timespec
structure, while the
.Dv TIMESPEC_TO_TIMEVAL
macro works in the opposite direction.
.Pp
When converting from a
.Vt struct timespec
to a
.Vt struct timeval
structure, the
.Fa tv_nsec
member is truncated, losing precision.
When converting from a
.Vt struct timeval
to a
.Vt struct timespec
structure, the
.Fa tv_usec
member is multiplied by 1000 to reach the precision of the target
structure.
The
.Fa tv_sec
member is always preserved, no matter which conversion is performed.
.Pp
Note that the
.Dv TIMEVAL_TO_TIMESPEC
and
.Dv TIMESPEC_TO_TIMEVAL
macros are non-standard but are commonly found on UNIX and UNIX-like systems.
