.SH NAME
smb \- configuration properties for Solaris CIFS server
.SH DESCRIPTION
Behavior of the Solaris CIFS server is defined by property values that are
stored in the Service Management Facility, \fBsmf\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
An authorized user can use the \fBsharectl\fR(1M) command to set global values
for these properties in SMF.
.sp
.LP
The following list describes the properties:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBads_site\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the site configured in DNS to look up Active Directory information.
Sites provide a mechanism to partition or delegate administration and policy
management, which are typically used in large or complex domains.
.sp
The value should not be set if you do not have a local Active Directory site.
By default, no value is set.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBautohome_map\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the full path for the SMD autohome map file, \fBsmbautohome\fR. The
default path is \fB/etc\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBbypass_traverse_checking\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
When set, allows the SMB server to bypass ACL "traverse" checks.
The default value is \fBtrue\fR, for Windows compatibility.
If this parameter is \fBfalse\fR, ACL checks require that
"traverse" (directory execute) is granted on every directory
above the directory the SMB client tries to access.
Windows shares are normally setup with the higher level
directories not specifically granting such access.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBdisposition\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A value that controls whether to disconnect the share or proceed if the map
command fails. The disposition property only has meaning when the map property
has been set. Otherwise it will have no effect.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
disposition = [ continue | terminate ]
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBcontinue\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Proceed with share connection if the map command fails. This is the default in
the event that disposition is not specified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBterminate\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Disconnect the share if the map command fails.
.RE

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBddns_enable\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enables or disables dynamic DNS updates. A value of \fBtrue\fR enables dynamic
updates, while a value of \fBfalse\fR disables dynamic updates. By default, the
value is \fBfalse\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBencrypt\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Controls SMB3 Encryption. For requests on a particular share, the server's
behavior is controlled by the stricter of this option and the per-share
"encrypt" option.
.sp
When set to \fBdisabled\fR, the server will not ask clients to encrypt requests.
When set to \fBenabled\fR, the server will ask clients to encrypt requests,
but will not require that they do so. Any message that can be encrypted
will be encrypted.
When set to \fBrequired\fR, the server will deny access to or disconnect
any client that does not support encryption or fails to encrypt requests
that they should.
.sp
In other words, the \fBenabled\fR behavior is that any message that CAN
be encrypted SHOULD be encrypted, while the \fBrequired\fR behavior is that any
message that CAN be encrypted MUST be encrypted.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBencrypt_cipher\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the maximum SMB 3.1.1 encryption cipher. This property is only used
when encryption is On (see \fBencrypt\fR property) and negotiated SMB dialect is
3.1.1 or higher (see \fBmax_protocol\fR property). Otherwise it is ignored.
.sp
When the property is set the valid values are aes-128-ccm and aes-128-gcm.
If aes-128-gcm is selected both CCM and GCM are allowed, but GCM is preferred.
If aes-128-ccm is selected it is the only allowed cipher. If the property is not
set explicitly the default value is used - aes-128-gcm.
.sp
The property can be set to one of these values:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBaes128-ccm\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
The only allowed cipher is AES-128-CCM. It is the only cipher used for SMB 3.0.2
dialect. In SMB 3.1.1 it is deprecated.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBaes128-gcm\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
Both AES-128-CCM and AES-128-GCM ciphers are allowed, but AES-128-GCM is
preferred.
.RE

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBipv6_enable\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enables IPv6 Internet protocol support within the CIFS Service. Valid values
are \fBtrue\fR and \fBfalse\fR. The default value is \fBfalse\fR.
.RE

.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBkeep_alive\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the number of seconds before an idle SMB connection is dropped by the
Solaris CIFS server. If set to 0, idle connections are not dropped. Valid
values are 0 and from 20 seconds and above. The default value is 0.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBlmauth_level\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the LAN Manager (LM) authentication level. The LM compatibility level
controls the type of user authentication to use in workgroup mode or domain
mode. The default value is 3.
.sp
The following describes the behavior at each level.
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB2\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
In Windows workgroup mode, the Solaris CIFS server accepts LM, NTLM, LMv2, and
NTLMv2 requests. In domain mode, the SMB redirector on the Solaris CIFS server
sends NTLM requests.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB3\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
In Windows workgroup mode, the Solaris CIFS server accepts LM, NTLM, LMv2, and
NTLMv2 requests. In domain mode, the SMB redirector on the Solaris CIFS server

.sp .6
.RS 4n
The client hostname, or \fB""\fR if not available.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB%L\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The server NetBIOS name.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB%m\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The client NetBIOS name, or \fB""\fR if not available. This option is only
valid for NetBIOS connections (port 139).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB%I\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The IP address of the client machine.
.RE

.sp

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The name of the share.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB%P\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The root directory of the share.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB%u\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The UID of the Unix user.
.RE

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBmax_protocol\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the maximum SMB protocol level that the SMB service
should allow clients to negotiate.  The default value is \fB2.1\fR.
Valid settings include: \fB1\fR, \fB2.1\fR, \fB3.0\fR
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBmin_protocol\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the minimum SMB protocol level that the SMB service
should allow clients to negotiate.  The default value is \fB1\fR.
Valid settings include: \fB1\fR, \fB2.1\fR, \fB3.0\fR
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBmax_workers\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the maximum number of worker threads that will be launched to process
incoming CIFS requests. The SMB \fBmax_mpx\fR value, which indicates to a
client the maximum number of outstanding SMB requests that it may have pending
on the server, is derived from the \fBmax_workers\fR value. To ensure
compatibility with older versions of Windows the lower 8-bits of \fBmax_mpx\fR
must not be zero. If the lower byte of \fBmax_workers\fR is zero, \fB64\fR is
added to the value. Thus the minimum value is \fB64\fR and the default value,
which appears in \fBsharectl\fR(1M) as \fB1024\fR, is \fB1088\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBnetbios_scope\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the NetBIOS scope identifier, which identifies logical NetBIOS
networks that are on the same physical network. When you specify a NetBIOS
scope identifier, the server filters the number of machines that are listed in
the browser display to make it easier to find other hosts. The value is a text
string that represents a domain name. By default, no value is set.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBoplock_enable\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Controls whether "oplocks" may be granted by the SMB server.
The term "oplock" is short for "opportunistic lock", which is
the legacy name for cache delegations in SMB.
By default, oplocks are enabled.
Note that if oplocks are disabled, file I/O performance may be
severely reduced.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBpdc\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the preferred IP address for the domain controller. This property is
sometimes used when there are multiple domain controllers to indicate which one
is preferred. If the specified domain controller responds, it is chosen even if
the other domain controllers are also available. By default, no value is set.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBrestrict_anonymous\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Disables anonymous access to IPC$, which requires that the client be
authenticated to get access to MSRPC services through IPC$. A value of
\fBtrue\fR disables anonymous access to IPC$, while a value of \fBfalse\fR
enables anonymous access.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBsigning_enabled\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Enables SMB signing. When signing is enabled but not required it is possible
for clients to connect regardless of whether or not the client supports SMB
signing. If a packet has been signed, the signature will be verified. If a
packet has not been signed it will be accepted without signature verification.
Valid values are \fBtrue\fR and \fBfalse\fR. The default value is \fBfalse\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBsigning_required\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
When SMB signing is required, all packets must be signed or they will be
rejected, and clients that do not support signing will be unable to connect to
the server. The \fBsigning_required\fR setting is only taken into account when
\fBsigning_enabled\fR is \fBtrue\fR. Valid values are \fBtrue\fR and
\fBfalse\fR. The default value is \fBfalse\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBsystem_comment\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies an optional description for the system, which is a text string. This
property value might appear in various places, such as Network Neighborhood or
Network Places on Windows clients. By default, no value is set.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBtraverse_mounts\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The \fBtraverse_mounts\fR setting determines how the SMB server
presents sub-mounts underneath an SMB share.  When \fBtraverse_mounts\fR
is \fBtrue\fR (the default), sub-mounts are presented to SMB clients
like any other subdirectory.   When \fBtraverse_mounts\fR is \fBfalse\fR,
sub-mounts are not shown to SMB clients.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBunmap\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The value is a command to be executed when disconnecting the share. The command
can take the same substitutions listed on the \fBmap\fR property.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBwins_exclude\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies a comma-separated list of network interfaces that should not be
registered with WINS. NetBIOS host announcements are made on excluded
interfaces.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBwins_server_1\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the IP address of the primary WINS server. By default, no value is
set.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBwins_server_2\fR\fR
