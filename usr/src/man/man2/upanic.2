.Sh NAME
.Nm upanic
.Nd user process panic
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In upanic.h
.Ft void noreturn
.Fo upanic
.Fa "const char *msg"
.Fa "size_t len"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn upanic
system call terminates the calling process and generates a core file in
the process, subject to the current core file settings as described in
.Xr core 4
and controlled by
.Xr coreadm 1M .
.Pp
Unlike
.Xr abort 3C ,
signals are not generated, which avoids two related challenges:
.Bl -enum
.It
A signal handler attempting to catch a
.Dv SIGABRT .
.It
Needing to make multiple system calls and potentially unmasking the
signal.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn upanic
system call allows an optional message to be transmitted that will be
put in a
.Dv NT_UPANIC
elf note in the resulting core file.
If a message is not desired, then one should pass
.Dv NULL
for
.Fa msg .
In general, it is expected that
.Fa msg
is a character string with a human-readable message; however, it may
include binary data.
The system will copy
.Fa len
bytes regardless of whether the string has a NUL character to terminate
it or not.
If
.Fa msg
points to an invalid value or
.Fa len
is a size that is larger than the system's internal maximum size, then
the process will still terminate; however, this will be noted in the
.Dv NT_UPANIC
elf note.
.Pp
The
.Fn upanic
system call is illumos-specific and not portable to other systems.
For portable applications, instead use
.Xr abort 3C .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn upanic
system call does not return.
It always terminates the process.
