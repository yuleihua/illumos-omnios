.Nd AMD SMN Temperature Sensor Driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pa /dev/sensors/temperature/cpu/*
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides the system access to the temperature sensor found in the
AMD System Management Network
.Pq SMN
on AMD Family 17h
.Pq Zen, Zen+, and Zen 2
processors.
.Pp
From this, the driver exposes temperature sensors.
On Family 17h systems, temperature sensors exist for each Zeppelin die,
of which there may be multiple in a single package.
This means that each sensor covers more than one core.
.Pp
Temperature information is available to the system via the fault
management architecture
.Pq FMA .
The file system location and programming interface to the
.Nm
driver are considered
.Sy Volatile ,
subject to change without notice, and should not be used directly.
Raw temperature information can be dumped through the FMA developer
utility fmtopo.
