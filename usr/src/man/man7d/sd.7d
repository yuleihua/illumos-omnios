.SH NAME
sd \- SCSI disk and ATAPI/SCSI CD-ROM device driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBsd@target,lun:partition\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
To open a device without checking if the vtoc is valid, use the O_NDELAY flag.
When the device is opened using O_NDELAY, the first read or write to the device
that happens after the open results in the label being read if the label is not
currently valid. Once read, the label remains valid until the last close of the
device. Except for reading the label, O_NDELAY has no impact on the driver.
.SS "SPARC"
The \fBsd\fR \fBSCSI\fR and \fBSCSI/ATAPI\fR driver supports embedded
\fBSCSI\fR-2 and \fBCCS\fR-compatible \fBSCSI\fR disk and CD-ROM drives,
\fBATAPI \fR 2.6 (SFF-8020i)-compliant CD-ROM drives, SFF-8090-compliant
\fBSCSI/ATAPI\fR DVD-ROM drives, IOMEGA \fBSCSI/ATAPI\fR ZIP drives, \fBSCSI
JAZ\fR drives, and USB mass storage devices (refer to \fBscsa2usb\fR(7D)).
.sp
.LP
To determine the disk drive type, use the \fBSCSI/ATAPI\fR inquiry command and
read the volume label stored on block 0 of the drive. (The volume label
describes the disk geometry and partitioning and must be present for the disk
to be mounted by the system.) A volume label is not required for removable,
re-writable or read-only media.
.SS "x86 Only"
The \fBsd\fR driver supports embedded \fBSCSI\fR-2 and \fBCCS\fR-compatible
\fBSCSI \fRdisk and CD-ROM drives, \fBATAPI \fR2.6 (SFF-8020i)-compliant CD-ROM
drives, SFF-8090-compliant \fBSCSI/ATAPI\fR DVD-ROM drives, IOMEGA
\fBSCSI/ATAPI\fR ZIP drives\fB, and SCSI JAZ\fR drives.
.sp
.LP
The x86 BIOS legacy requires a master boot record (MBR) and \fBfdisk\fR table
in the first physical sector of the bootable media. If the x86 hard disk
contains a Solaris disk label, it is located in the second 512-byte sector of
the FDISK partition.
.SH DEVICE SPECIAL FILES
Block-files access the disk using normal buffering mechanism and are read-from
and written-to without regard to physical disk records. A \fBraw\fR interface
enables direct transmission between the disk and the user's read or write
buffer. A single \fBread\fR or \fBwrite\fR call usually results in a single I/O
operation, therefore raw I/O is more efficient when many bytes are transmitted.
Block files names are found in \fB/dev/dsk\fR; raw file names are found in
\fB/dev/rdsk\fR.
.sp
.LP
I/O requests to the raw device must be aligned on a 512-byte (\fBDEV_BSIZE\fR)
boundary and all I/O request lengths must be in multiples of 512 bytes.
Requests that do not meet these requirements will trigger an \fBEINVAL\fR
error. There are no alignment or length restrictions on I/O requests to the
block device.
.SH CD-ROM DRIVE SUPPORT
A CD-ROM disk is single-sided and contains approximately 640 megabytes of data
or 74 minutes of audio. When the CD-ROM is opened, the eject button is disabled
to prevent manual removal of the disk until the last \fBclose()\fR is called.
No volume label is required for a CD-ROM. The disk geometry and partitioning
information are constant and never change. If the CD-ROM contains data recorded
in a Solaris-aware file system format, it can be mounted using the appropriate
Solaris file system support.
.SH DVD-ROM DRIVE SUPPORT
DVD-ROM media can be single or double-sided and can be recorded upon using a
single or double layer structure. Double-layer media provides parallel or
opposite track paths. A DVD-ROM can hold from between 4.5 Gbytes and 17 Gbytes
of data, depending on the layer structure used for recording and if the DVD-ROM
is single or double-sided.
.sp
.LP
When the DVD-ROM is opened, the eject button is disabled to prevent the manual
removal of a disk until the last \fBclose()\fR is called. No volume label is
required for a DVD-ROM. If the DVD-ROM contains data recorded in a
Solaris-aware file system format, it can be mounted using the appropriate
Solaris file system support.
.SH ZIP/JAZ DRIVE SUPPORT
\fBZIP/JAZ\fR media provide varied data capacity points; a single \fBJAZ
\fRdrive can store up to 2 GBytes of data, while a ZIP-250 can store up to
250MBytes of data. \fBZIP/JAZ\fR drives can be read-from or written-to using
the appropriate drive.
.sp
.LP
When a \fBZIP/JAZ\fR drive is opened, the eject button is disabled to prevent
the manual removal of a disk until the last \fBclose()\fR is called. No volume
label is required for a \fBZIP/JAZ\fR drive. If the \fBZIP/JAZ\fR drive
contains data recorded in a Solaris-aware file system format, it can be mounted
using the appropriate Solaris file system support.
.SH DEVICE STATISTICS SUPPORT
Each device maintains I/O statistics for the device and for partitions
allocated for that device. For each device/partition, the driver accumulates
reads, writes, bytes read, and bytes written. The driver also initiates
hi-resolution time stamps at queue entry and exit points to enable monitoring
of residence time and cumulative residence-length product for each queue.
.sp
.LP
Not all device drivers make per-partition IO statistics available for
reporting. \fBsd\fR and \fBssd\fR(7D) per-partition statistics are enabled by
default but may be disabled in their configuration files.
.SH IOCTLS
Refer to \fBdkio\fR(7I), and \fBcdio\fR(7I)

.SH CONFIGURATION
The \fBsd\fR driver can be configured by defining properties in the
\fBsd.conf\fR file. The \fBsd\fR driver supports the following properties:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBenable-partition-kstats\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 27n
The default value is 1, which causes partition IO statistics to be maintained.
Set this value to zero to prevent the driver from recording partition
statistics. This slightly reduces the CPU overhead for IO, minimizes the amount
of \fBsar\fR(1) data collected and makes these statistics unavailable for
reporting by \fBiostat\fR(1M) even though the \fB-p\fR/\fB-P\fR option is
specified. Regardless of this setting, disk IO statistics are always
maintained.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBqfull-retries\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 27n
The supplied value is passed as the \fBqfull-retries\fR capability value of the

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBqfull-retry-interval\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 27n
The supplied value is passed as the \fBqfull-retry interval\fR capability value

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBallow-bus-device-reset\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 27n
The default value is 1, which allows resetting to occur. Set this value to
\fB0\fR (zero) to prevent the \fBsd\fR driver from calling \fBscsi_reset\fR(9F)
with a second argument of \fBRESET_TARGET\fR when in error-recovery mode. This
\fBscsi_reset\fR(9F) call may prompt the HBA driver to send a SCSI Bus Device
Reset message. The \fBscsi_reset\fR(9F) call with a second argument of
\fBRESET_TARGET\fR may result from an explicit request via the \fBUSCSICMD\fR
\fBioctl\fR. Some high-availability multi-initiator systems may wish to
prohibit the Bus Device Reset message; to do this, set the
\fBallow-bus-device-reset\fR property to \fB0\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fBoptical-device-bind\fR
.ad
.RS 27n
Controls the binding of the driver to non self-identifying SCSI target optical
devices. (See \fBscsi\fR(4)). The default value is 1, which causes \fBsd\fR to
bind to DTYPE_OPTICAL devices (as noted in \fBscsi\fR(4)).  Setting this value
to 0 prevents automatic binding. The default behavior for the SPARC-based
\fBsd\fR driver prior to Solaris 9 was not to bind to optical devices.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBpower-condition\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 27n
Boolean type, when set to \fBFalse\fR, it indicates that the disk does not
support \fBpower condition\fR field in the \fBSTART STOP UNIT\fR command.
.RE

.sp
.LP
In addition to the above properties, some device-specific tunables can be
configured in \fBsd.conf\fR using the \fBsd-config-list\fR global property. The
value of this property is a list of duplets. The formal syntax is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
sd-config-list = <duplet> [, <duplet> ]* ;

where

<duplet>:= "<vid+pid>" , "<tunable-list>"

and

<tunable-list>:= <tunable>  [, <tunable> ]*;
<tunable> = <name> : <value>

The <vid+pid> is the string that is returned by the target device
on a SCSI inquiry command.

The <tunable-list> contains one or more tunables to apply to
all target devices with the specified <vid+pid>.

Each <tunable> is a <name> : <value> pair. Supported
tunable names are:

   delay-busy: when busy, nsecs of delay before retry.

   retries-timeout: retries to perform on an IO timeout.
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBmmc-gesn-polling\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 20n
For optical drives compliant with \fBMMC-3\fR and supporting the \fBGET EVENT
STATUS NOTIFICATION\fR command, this command is used for periodic media state
polling, usually initiated by the \fBDKIOCSTATE\fR \fBdkio\fR(7I) ioctl. To
disable the use of this command, set this boolean property to \fBfalse\fR. In
that case, either the \fBTEST UNIT READY\fR or zero-length \fBWRITE(10)\fR
command is used instead.
