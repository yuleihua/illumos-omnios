.Nm mlxcx
.Nd Mellanox ConnectX-4/5/6 Ethernet controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pa /dev/net/mlxcx*
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Sy mlxcx
driver is a GLDv3 NIC driver for the ConnectX-4, ConnectX-4 Lx, ConnectX-5 and
ConnectX-6 families of ethernet controllers from Mellanox.
It supports the Data Link Provider Interface,
.Xr dlpi 7P .
.Pp
This driver supports:
.Bl -dash -offset indent
.It
Jumbo frames up to 9000 bytes.
.It
Checksum offload for TCP, UDP, IPv4 and IPv6.
.It
Group support with VLAN and MAC steering to avoid software classification
when using VNICs.
.It
Promiscuous access via
.Xr snoop 1M and
.Xr dlpi 7P
.It
LED control
.It
Transceiver information
.It
Internal temperature sensors
.El
.Pp
At this time, the driver does not support Large Send Offload (LSO), energy
efficient Ethernet (EEE), or the use of flow control through hardware pause
frames.
.Sh CONFIGURATION
The
.Sy mlxcx.conf
file contains user configurable parameters, including the ability to set the
number of rings and groups advertised to MAC, the sizes of rings and groups,
and the maximum number of MAC address filters available.
.Sh PROPERTIES
The driver supports the following device properties which may be tuned through
its driver.conf file,
.Pa /kernel/drv/mlxcx.conf .
These properties cannot be changed after the driver has been attached.
.Pp
These properties are not considered stable at this time, and may change.

.It Sy eq_size_shift
.Bd -filled -compact
Minimum:
.Sy 2 |
Maximum:
.Sy device dependent (up to 255)
.Ed
.Bd -filled
The
.Sy eq_size_shift
property determines the number of entries on Event Queues for the device.
The number of entries is calculated as
.Dv (1 << eq_size_shift) ,
so a value of 9 would mean 512 entries are created on each Event Queue.
The default value is
.Sy 9 .
.Ed
.It Sy cq_size_shift
.Bd -filled -compact
Minimum:
.Sy 2 |
Maximum:
.Sy device dependent (up to 255)
.Ed
.Bd -filled
The
.Sy cq_size_shift
property determines the number of entries on Completion Queues for the device.
The number of entries is calculated as
.Li (1 << cq_size_shift) ,
so a value of 9 would mean 512 entries are created on each Event Queue.
The default value is device dependent,
.Sy 10
for devices with maximum supported speed of 10Gb/s or less and
.Sy 12
for devices with higher supported speeds.
This should be kept very close to the value set for
.Sy rq_size_shift
and
.Sy sq_size_shift .
.Ed
.It Sy rq_size_shift
.Bd -filled -compact
Minimum:
.Sy 2 |
Maximum:
.Sy device dependent (up to 255)
.Ed
.Bd -filled
The
.Sy rq_size_shift
property determines the number of descriptors on Receive Queues for the device.
The number of descriptors is calculated as
.Dv (1 << rq_size_shift) ,
so a value of 9 would mean 512 descriptors are created on each Receive Queue.
This sets the number of packets on RX rings advertised to MAC.
The default value is device dependent,
.Sy 10
for devices with maximum supported speed of 10Gb/s or less and
.Sy 12
for devices with higher supported speeds.
.Ed
.It Sy sq_size_shift
.Bd -filled -compact
Minimum:
.Sy 2 |
Maximum:
.Sy device dependent (up to 255)
.Ed
.Bd -filled
The
.Sy sq_size_shift
property determines the number of descriptors on Send Queues for the device.
The number of descriptors is calculated as
.Dv (1 << sq_size_shift) ,
so a value of 9 would mean 512 descriptors are created on each Send Queue.
This sets the number of packets on RX rings advertised to MAC.
The default value is device dependent,
.Sy 11
for devices with maximum supported speed of 10Gb/s or less and
.Sy 13
for devices with higher supported speeds.
Note that large packets often occupy more than one descriptor slot on the SQ,
so it is sometimes a good idea to increase this if using a large MTU.
.Ed
.It Sy tx_ngroups
.Bd -filled -compact
Minimum:
.Sy 1 |
Maximum:
.Sy device dependent
.Ed
.Bd -filled
The
.Sy tx_ngroups
property determines the number of TX groups advertised to MAC.
The default value is
.Sy 1 .
.Ed
.It Sy tx_nrings_per_group
.Bd -filled -compact
Minimum:
.Sy 1 |
Maximum:
.Sy device dependent
.Ed
.Bd -filled
The
.Sy tx_nrings_per_group
property determines the number of rings in each TX group advertised to MAC.
The default value is
.Sy 64 .
.Ed
.It Sy rx_ngroups_large
.Bd -filled -compact
Minimum:
.Sy 1 |
Maximum:
.Sy device dependent
.Ed
.Bd -filled
The
.Sy rx_ngroups_large
property determines the number of "large" RX groups advertised to MAC.
The size of "large" RX groups is set by the
.Sy rx_nrings_per_large_group
property.
The default value is
.Sy 2 .
.Ed
.It Sy rx_nrings_per_large_group
.Bd -filled -compact
Minimum:
.Sy 1 |
Maximum:
.Sy device dependent
.Ed
.Bd -filled
The
.Sy rx_nrings_per_large_group
property determines the number of rings in each "large" RX group advertised to
MAC.
The number of such groups is determined by the
.Sy rx_ngroups_large
property.
The default value is
.Sy 16 .
.Ed
.It Sy rx_ngroups_small
.Bd -filled -compact
Minimum:
.Sy 1 |
Maximum:
.Sy device dependent
.Ed
.Bd -filled
The
.Sy rx_ngroups_small
property determines the number of "small" RX groups advertised to MAC.
The size of "small" RX groups is set by the
.Sy rx_nrings_per_small_group
property.
It is recommended to use many small groups when using a large number of
VNICs on top of the NIC (e.g. on a system with many zones).
The default value is
.Sy 256 .
.Ed
.It Sy rx_nrings_per_small_group
.Bd -filled -compact
Minimum:
.Sy 1 |
Maximum:
.Sy device dependent
.Ed
.Bd -filled
The
.Sy rx_nrings_per_small_group
property determines the number of rings in each "small" RX group advertised to
MAC.
The number of such groups is determined by the
.Sy rx_ngroups_small
property.
The default value is
.Sy 4 .
.Ed
.It Sy ftbl_root_size_shift
.Bd -filled -compact
Minimum:
.Sy 4 |
Maximum:
.Sy device dependent
.Ed
.Bd -filled
The
.Sy ftbl_root_size_shift
property determines the number of flow table entries on the root flow table,
and therefore how many MAC addresses can be filtered into groups across the
entire NIC.
The number of flow entries is calculated as
.Dv (1 << ftbl_root_size_shift) ,
so a value of 9 would mean 512 entries are created in the root flow table.
The default value is
.Sy 12 .
.Ed
.It Sy cqemod_period_usec
.Bd -filled -compact
Minimum:
.Sy 1 |
Maximum:
.Sy 65535
.Ed
.Bd -filled
The
.Sy cqemod_period_usec
property determines the maximum delay after a completion event has occurred
before an event queue entry (and thus an interrupt) is generated.
The delay is measured in microseconds.
The default value is
.Sy 50 .
.Ed
.It Sy cqemod_count
.Bd -filled -compact
Minimum:
.Sy 1 |
Maximum:
.Sy 65535
.Ed
.Bd -filled
The
.Sy cqemod_count
property determines the maximum number of completion events that can have
occurred before an event queue entry (and thus an interrupt) is generated.
The default value is
.Sy 80% of the CQ size .
.Ed
.It Sy intrmod_period_usec
.Bd -filled -compact
Minimum:
.Sy 1 |
Maximum:
.Sy 65535
.Ed
.Bd -filled
The
.Sy intrmod_period_usec
property determines the maximum delay after an event queue entry has been
generated before an interrupt is raised.
The delay is measured in microseconds.
The default value is
.Sy 10 .
.Ed
.It Sy tx_bind_threshold
.Bd -filled -compact
Minimum:
.Sy 1 |
Maximum:
.Sy 65535
.Ed
.Bd -filled
The
.Sy tx_bind_threshold
property determines the minimum number of bytes in a packet before the driver
uses
.Xr ddi_dma_addr_bind_handle 9F
to bind the packet memory for DMA, rather than copying the memory as it does
for small packets.
DMA binds are expensive and involve taking locks in the PCI nexus driver, so it
is seldom worth using them for small packets.
The default value is
.Sy 2048 .
.Ed
.It Sy rx_limit_per_completion
.Bd -filled -compact
Minimum:
.Sy 16 |
Maximum:
.Sy 4096
.Ed
.Bd -filled
The
.Sy rx_limit_per_completion
property determines the maximum number of packets that
will be processed on a given completion ring during a single interrupt.
This is done to try and guarantee some amount of liveness in the system.
The default value is
.Sy 256 .
