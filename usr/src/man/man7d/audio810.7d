.SH NOTES
Some laptops (including Sony VAIO, among others), have their on-board amplifier
powered down by default, meaning that audio is suppressed even if hardware and
the \fBaudio810\fR driver are working normally. To correct this, set the
\fBac97-invert-amp=1\fR property in the \fB/kernel/drv/audio810.conf\fR to
power-up the amplifier.

The interrupt rate in \fBaudio810.conf\fR is set too low. It has been reset to
the rate specified in the message. Update \fBaudio810.conf\fR to a higher
interrupt rate.
