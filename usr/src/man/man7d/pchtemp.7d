Temperature information is available to the system via the fault
management architecture
.Pq FMA .
The file system location and programming interface to the
.Nm
driver are considered
.Sy Volatile ,
subject to change without notice, and should not be used directly.
Raw temperature information can be dumped through the FMA developer
utility
