.SH NAME
ssd \- Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop disk device driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBssd@\fR\fIport\fR\fB,\fR\fItarget\fR\fB:\fR\fIpartition\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
 The \fBssd\fR driver supports Fibre Channel disk devices.
.sp
.LP
The specific type of each disk is determined by the \fBSCSI\fR inquiry command
and reading the volume label stored on block 0 of the drive. The volume label
describes the disk geometry and partitioning; it must be present or the disk
cannot be mounted by the system.
.sp
.LP
The block-files access the disk using the system's normal buffering mechanism
and are read and written without regard to physical disk records. A "raw"
interface provides for direct transmission between the disk and the read or
write buffer. A single read or write call usually results in one I/O operation;
raw I/O is therefore more efficient when many bytes are transmitted. Block file
names are found in \fB/dev/dsk\fR; the names of the raw files are found in
\fB/dev/rdsk\fR.
.sp
.LP
I/O requests (such as \fBlseek\fR(2)) to the \fBSCSI\fR disk must have an
offset that is a multiple of 512 bytes (\fBDEV_BSIZE\fR), or the driver returns
an \fBEINVAL\fR error. If the transfer length is not a multiple of 512 bytes,
the transfer count is rounded up by the driver.
.sp
.LP
Partition 0 is normally used for the root file system on a disk, with partition
1 as a paging area (for example, \fBswap\fR). Partition 2 is used to back up
the entire disk. Partition 2 normally maps the entire disk and may also be used
as the mount point for secondary disks in the system. The rest of the disk is
normally partition 6. For the primary disk, the user file system is located
here.
.sp
.LP
The device has associated error statistics. These must include counters for
hard errors, soft errors and transport errors. Other data may be implemented as
required.
.SH DEVICE STATISTICS SUPPORT
The device maintains I/O statistics for the device and for partitions allocated
for that device. For each device/partition, the  driver accumulates reads,
writes, bytes read, and bytes written. The driver also initiates hi-resolution
time stamps at queue entry and exit points to enable monitoring of residence
time and cumulative residence-length product for each queue.
.sp
.LP
Not all device drivers make per-partition IO statistics available for
reporting. \fBssd\fR and \fBsd\fR(7D) per-partition statistics are  enabled by
default but may be disabled in their configuration files.
.SH IOCTLS
Refer to  \fBdkio\fR(7I).

.SH CONFIGURATION
You configure the \fBssd\fR driver by defining  properties in the
\fBssd.conf\fR file. The \fBssd\fR driver supports the following properties:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBenable-partition-kstats\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 27n
The default value is 1, which causes partition IO statistics to be maintained.
Set this value to zero to prevent the driver from recording partition
statistics. This slightly reduces the CPU overhead for IO, minimizes the amount
of \fBsar\fR(1) data collected and makes these statistics unavailable for
reporting by \fBiostat\fR(1M) even though the \fB-p\fR/\fB-P\fR option is
specified.  Regardless of this setting, disk IO statistics are always
maintained.
.RE

.sp
.LP
In addition to the above properties, some device-specific tunables can be
configured in \fBssd.conf\fR using the 'ssd-config-list' global property. The
value of this property is a list of duplets. The formal syntax is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
ssd-config-list =	<duplet> [, <duplet> ]* ;

where

<duplet>:=        "<vid+pid>" , "<tunable-list>"

and

<tunable-list>:=   <tunable>  [, <tunable> ]*;
<tunable> =        <name> : <value>

The <vid+pid> is the string that is returned by the target device
on a SCSI inquiry command.

The <tunable-list> contains one or more tunables to apply to
all target devices with the specified <vid+pid>.

Each <tunable> is a <name> : <value> pair. Supported
tunable names are:

   delay-busy:	when busy, nsecs of delay before retry.

   retries-timeout:	retries to perform on an IO timeout.

.SH EXAMPLES

The following is an example of a global ssd-config-list property:

   ssd-config-list =
      "SUN     T4", "delay-busy:600, retries-timeout:6",
      "SUN     StorEdge_3510", "retries-timeout:3";
