# Prerequisites
#
# The uts/Makefile defines build parallelism for x86 platforms such that i86pc,
# i86xpv and intel are all built in parallel. This requires building certain
# parts before the parallel build can start. The uts/Makefile appends the
# '.prereq' string to the original target and executes this Makefile to build
# any prerequisites needed before the full parallel build can start. After that
# make continues with normal targets.
#
# Any build prerequisites for x86 builds should be described here.
#
# genassym is used to build intel/dtrace and genunix, so it should be built
# first.
#
# priv_const.c is required to build genunix.
#
# genunix is used by everyone to ctf-merge with. Genunix is CTF-merged with
#   intel/ip so as a side effect this dependency builds intel/ip as part of the
#   prerequisites.
#
# intel/dtrace depends on i86pc/genassym, so we need to build both
# i86pc/genassym and intel/genassym.
