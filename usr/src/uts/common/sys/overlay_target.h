/*
 * The following ioctls are all used to support dynamic lookups from userland,
 * generally serviced by varpd.
 *
 * The way this is designed to work is that user land will have threads sitting
 * in OVERLAY_TARG_LOOKUP ioctls waiting to service requests. A thread will sit
 * waiting for work for up to approximately one second of time before they will
 * be sent back out to user land to give user land a chance to clean itself up
 * or more generally, come back into the kernel for work. Once these threads
 * return, they will have a request with which more action can be done. The
 * following ioctls can all be used to answer the request.
 *
 *	OVERLAY_TARG_RESPOND - overlay_targ_resp_t
 *
 *		The overlay_targ_resp_t has the appropriate information from
 *		which a reply can be generated. The information is filled into
 *		an overlay_targ_point_t as appropriate based on the
 *		overlay_plugin_dest_t type.
 *
 *
 *	OVERLAY_TARG_DROP - overlay_targ_resp_t
 *
 *		The overlay_targ_resp_t should identify a request for which to
 *		drop a packet.
 *
 *
 * 	OVERLAY_TARG_INJECT - overlay_targ_pkt_t
 *
 * 		The overlay_targ_pkt_t injects a fully formed packet into the
 * 		virtual network. It may either be identified by its data link id
 * 		or by the request id. If both are specified, the
 * 		datalink id will be used. Note, that an injection is not
 * 		considered a reply and if this corresponds to a requeset, then
 * 		that individual packet must still be dropped.
 *
 *
 * 	OVERLAY_TARG_PKT - overlay_targ_pkt_t
 *
 * 		This ioctl can be used to copy data from a given request into a
 * 		user buffer. This can be used in combination with
 * 		OVERLAY_TARG_INJECT to implemnt services such as a proxy-arp.
 *
 *
 * 	OVERLAY_TARG_RESEND - overlay_targ_pkt_t
 *
 * 		This ioctl is similar to the OVERLAY_TARG_INJECT, except instead
 * 		of receiving it on the local mac handle, it queues it for
 * 		retransmission again. This is useful if you have a packet that
 * 		was originally destined for some broadcast or multicast address
 * 		that you now want to send to a unicast address.

 * 	OVERLAY_TARG_CACHE_GET - overlay_targ_cache_t

 * 		the desired mac address filled in. On return, it will fill in
 * 		the otc_dest member, if the entry exists in the table.
 *
 *
 * 	OVERLAY_TARG_CACHE_SET - overlay_targ_cache_t
 *
 * 		The cache table entry of the mac address referred to by otc_mac
 * 		and otd_linkid will be filled in with the details provided by in
 * 		the otc_dest member.
 *
 * 	OVERLAY_TARG_CACHE_REMOVE - overlay_targ_cache_t
 *
 * 		Removes the cache entry identified by otc_mac from the table.
 * 		Note that this does not stop any in-flight lookups or deal with
 * 		any data that is awaiting a lookup.
 *
 *
 * 	OVERLAY_TARG_CACHE_FLUSH - overlay_targ_cache_t
 *
 * 		Similar to OVERLAY_TARG_CACHE_REMOVE, but functions on the
 * 		entire table identified by otc_linkid. All other parameters are
 * 		ignored.
 *
 *
 * 	OVERLAY_TARG_CACHE_ITER - overlay_targ_cache_iter_t
 *
 * 		Iterates over the contents of a target cache identified by
 * 		otci_linkid. Iteration is guaranteed to be exactly once for
 * 		items which are in the hashtable at the beginning and end of
 * 		iteration. For items which are added or removed after iteration
 * 		has begun, only at most once semantics are guaranteed. Consumers
 * 		should ensure that otci_marker is zeroed before starting
 * 		iteration and should preserve its contents across calls.
 *
 * 		Before calling in, otci_count should be set to the number of
 * 		entries that space has been allocated for in otci_ents. The
 * 		value will be updated to indicate the total number written out.
