 * Overlay Devices
 *
 * Overlay devices provide a means for creating overlay networks, a means of
 * multiplexing multiple logical, isolated, and discrete layer two and layer
 * three networks on top of one physical network.
 *
 * In general, these overlay devices encapsulate the logic to answer two
 * different questions:
 *
 *   1) How should I transform a packet to put it on the wire?
 *   2) Where should I send a transformed packet?
 *
 * Each overlay device is presented to the user as a GLDv3 device. While the
 * link itself cannot have an IP interface created on top of it, it allows for
 * additional GLDv3 devices, such as a VNIC, to be created on top of it which
 * can be plumbed up with IP interfaces.
 *
 *
 * --------------------
 * General Architecture
 * --------------------
 *
 * The logical overlay device that a user sees in dladm(1M) is a combination of
 * two different components that work together. The first component is this
 * kernel module, which is responsible for answering question one -- how should
 * I transform a packet to put it on the wire.
 *
 * The second component is what we call the virtual ARP daemon, or varpd. It is
 * a userland component that is responsible for answering the second question --
 * Where should I send a transformed packet. Instances of the kernel overlay
 * GLDv3 device ask varpd the question of where should a packet go.
 *
 * The split was done for a few reasons. Importantly, we wanted to keep the act
 * of generating encapsulated packets in the kernel so as to ensure that the
 * general data path was fast and also kept simple. On the flip side, while the
 * question of where should something go may be simple, it may often be
 * complicated and need to interface with several different external or
 * distributed systems. In those cases, it's simpler to allow for the full
 * flexibility of userland to be brought to bear to solve that problem and in
 * general, the path isn't very common.
 *
 * The following is what makes up the logical overlay device that a user would
 * create with dladm(1M).

 *
 *
 * This image shows the two different components and where they live.
 * Importantly, it also shows that both the kernel overlay device and the
 * userland varpd both support plugins. The plugins actually implement the
 * things that users care about and the APIs have been designed to try to
 * minimize the amount of things that a module writer needs to worry about it.
 *
 * IDENTIFIERS
 *
 * Every overlay device is defined by a unique identifier which is the overlay
 * identifier. Its purpose is similar to that of a VLAN identifier, it's a
 * unique number that is used to differentiate between different entries on the
 * wire.
 *
 * ENCAPSULATION
 *
 * An overlay encapsulation plugin is a kernel miscellaneous module whose
 * purpose is to contain knowledge about how to transform packets to put them
 * onto the wire and to take them off. An example of an encapsulation plugin is
 * vxlan. It's also how support for things like nvgre or geneve would be brought
 * into the system.
 *
 * Each encapsulation plugins defines a series of operation vectors and
 * properties. For the full details on everything they should provide, please
 * read uts/common/sys/overlay_plugin.h. The encapsulation plugin is responsible
 * for telling the system what information is required to send a packet. For
 * example, vxlan is defined to send everything over a UDP packet and therefore
 * requires a port and an IP address, while nvgre on the other hand is its own
 * IP type and therefore just requires an IP address. In addition, it also
 * provides information about the kind of socket that should be created. This is
 * used by the kernel multiplexor, more of that in the Kernel Components
 * section.
 *
 * LOOKUPS
 *
 * The kernel communicates requests for lookups over the character device
 * /dev/overlay. varpd is responsible for listening for requests on that device
 * and answering them. The character device is specific to the target path and
 * varpd.
 *
 * Much as the kernel overlay module handles the bulk of the scaffolding but
 * leaves the important work to the encapsulation plugin, varpd provides a
 * similar role and leaves the full brunt of lookups to a userland dynamic
 * shared object which implements the logic of lookups.
 *
 * Each lookup plugin defines a series of operation vectors and properties. For
 * the full details on everything that they should provide, please read
 * lib/varpd/libvarpd/libvarpd_provider.h. Essentially, they are given a MAC
 * address and asked to give an address on the physical network that it should
 * be sent to. In addition, they handle questions related to how to handle
 * things like broadcast and multicast traffic, etc.
 *
 * ----------
 * Properties
 * ----------
 *
 * A device from a dladm perspective has a unique set of properties that are
 * combined from three different sources:
 *
 *   1) Generic properties that every overlay device has
 *   2) Properties that are specific to the encapsulation plugin
 *   3) Properties that are specific to the lookup plugin
 *
 * All of these are exposed in a single set of properties in dladm. Note that
 * these are not necessarily traditional link properties. However, if something
 * is both a traditional GLDv3 link property, say the MTU of a device, and a
 * specific property here, than the driver ensures that all existing GLDv3
 * specific means of manipulating it are used and wraps up its private property
 * interfaces to ensure that works.
 *
 * Properties in the second and third category are prefixed with the name of
 * their module. For example, the vxlan encapsulation module has a property
 * called the 'listen_ip'. This property would show up in dladm as
 * 'vxlan/listen_ip'. This allows different plugins to both use similar names
 * for similar properties and to also have independent name spaces so that
 * overlapping names do not conflict with anything else.
 *
 * While the kernel combines both sets one and two into a single coherent view,
 * it does not do anything with respect to the properties that are owned by the
 * lookup plugin -- those are owned wholly by varpd. Instead, libdladm is in
 * charge of bridging these two worlds into one magical experience for the user.
 * It carries the burden of knowing about both overlay specific and varpd
 * specific properties. Importantly, we want to maintain this distinction. We
 * don't want to treat the kernel as an arbitrary key/value store for varpd and
 * we want the kernel to own its own data and not have to ask userland for
 * information that it owns.
 *
 * Every property in the system has the following attributes:
 *
 *   o A name
 *   o A type
 *   o A size
 *   o Permissions
 *   o Default value
 *   o Valid value ranges
 *   o A value
 *
 * Everything except for the value is obtained by callers through the propinfo
 * callbacks and a property has a maximum size of OVERLAY_PROP_SIZEMAX,
 * currently 256 bytes.
 *
 * The following are the supported types of properties:
 *
 * 	OVERLAY_PROP_T_INT
 *
 * 		A signed integer, its length is 8 bytes, corresponding to a
 * 		int64_t.
 *
 * 	OVERLAY_PROP_T_UINT
 *
 * 		An unsigned integer, its length is 8 bytes, corresponding to a
 * 		uint64_t.
 *
 * 	OVERLAY_PROP_T_IP
 *
 * 		A struct in6_addr, it has a fixed size.
 *
 * 	OVERLAY_PROP_T_STRING
 *
 * 		A null-terminated character string encoded in either ASCII or
 * 		UTF-8. Note that the size of the string includes the null
 * 		terminator.
 *
 * The next thing that we apply to a property is its permission. The permissions
 * are put together by the bitwise or of the following flags and values.
 *
 * 	OVERLAY_PROP_PERM_REQ
 *
 * 		This indicates a required property. A property that is required
 * 		must be set by a consumer before the device can be created. If a
 * 		required property has a default property, this constraint is
 * 		loosened because the default property defines the value.
 *
 * 	OVERLAY_PORP_PERM_READ
 *
 * 		This indicates that a property can be read. All properties will
 * 		have this value set.
 *
 * 	OVERLAY_PROP_PERM_WRITE
 *
 * 		This indicates that a property can be written to and thus
 * 		updated by userland. Properties that are only intended to
 * 		display information, will not have OVERLAY_PROP_PERM_WRITE set.
 *
 * In addition, a few additional values are defined as a convenience to
 * consumers. The first, OVERLAY_PROP_PERM_RW, is a combination of
 * OVERLAY_PROP_PERM_READ and OVERLAY_PERM_PROP_WRITE. The second,
 * OVERLAY_PROP_PERM_RRW, is a combination of OVERLAY_PROP_PERM_REQ,
 * OVERLAY_PROP_PERM_READ, and OVERLAY_PROP_PERM_WRITE. The protection mode of a
 * property should generally be a constant across its lifetime.
 *
 * A property may optionally have a default value. If it does have a default
 * value, and that property is not set to be a different value, then the default
 * value is inherited automatically. It also means that if the default value is
 * acceptable, there is no need to set the value for a required property. For
 * example, the vxlan module has the vxlan/listen_port property which is
 * required, but has a default value of 4789 (the IANA assigned port). Because
 * of that default value, there is no need for it to be set.
 *
 * Finally, a property may declare a list of valid values. These valid values
 * are used for display purposes, they are not enforced by the broader system,
 * but merely allow a means for the information to be communicated to the user
 * through dladm(1M). Like a default value, this is optional.
 *
 * The general scaffolding does not do very much with respect to the getting and
 * setting of properties. That is really owned by the individual plugins
 * themselves.
 *
 * -----------------------------
 * Destinations and Plugin Types
 * -----------------------------
 *
 * Both encapsulation and lookup plugins define the kinds of destinations that
 * they know how to support. There are three different pieces of information
 * that can be used to address to a destination currently, all of which is
 * summarized in the type overlay_point_t. Any combination of these is
 * supported.
 *
 * 	OVERLAY_PLUGIN_D_ETHERNET
 *
 * 		An Ethernet MAC address is required.
 *
 * 	OVERLAY_PLUGIN_D_IP
 *
 * 		An IP address is required. All IP addresses used by the overlay
 * 		system are transmitted as IPv6 addresses. IPv4 addresses can be
 * 		represented by using IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.
 *
 * 	OVERLAY_PLUGIN_D_PORT
 *
 * 		A TCP/UDP port is required.
 *
 * A kernel encapsulation plugin declares which of these that it requires, it's
 * a static set. On the other hand, a userland lookup plugin can be built to
 * support all of these or any combination thereof. It gets passed the required
 * destination type, based on the kernel encapsulation method, and then it makes
 * the determination as to whether or not it supports it. For example, the
 * direct plugin can support either an IP or both an IP and a port, it simply
 * doesn't display the direct/dest_port property in the cases where a port is
 * not required to support this.
 *
 * The user lookup plugins have two different modes of operation which
 * determines how they interact with the broader system and how look ups are
 * performed. These types are:
 *
 * 	OVERLAY_TARGET_POINT
 *
 * 		A point to point plugin has a single static definition for where
 * 		to send all traffic. Every packet in the system always gets sent
 * 		to the exact same destination which is programmed into the
 * 		kernel when the general device is activated.
 *
 * 	OVERLAY_TARGET_DYNAMIC
 *
 * 		A dynamic plugin does not have a single static definition.
 * 		Instead, for each destination, the kernel makes an asynchronous
 * 		request to varpd to determine where the packet should be routed,
 * 		and if a specific destination is found, then that destination is
 * 		cached in the overlay device's target cache.
 *
 * This distinction, while important for the general overlay device's operation,
 * is not important to the encapsulation plugins. They don't need to know about
 * any of these pieces. It's just a concern for varpd, the userland plugin, and
 * the general overlay scaffolding.
 *
 * When an overlay device is set to OVERLAY_TARGET_POINT, then it does not
 * maintain a target cache, and instead just keeps track of the destination and
 * always sends encapsulated packets to that address. When the target type is of
 * OVERLAY_TARGET_DYNAMIC, then the kernel maintains a cache of all such
 * destinations. These destinations are kept around in an instance of a
 * reference hash that is specific to the given overlay device. Entries in the
 * cache can be invalidated and replaced by varpd and its lookup plugins.
 *
 * ----------------------------------
 * Kernel Components and Architecture
 * ----------------------------------
 *
 * There are multiple pieces inside the kernel that work together, there is the
 * general overlay_dev_t structure, which is the logical GLDv3 device, but it
 * itself has references to things like an instance of an encapsulation plugin,
 * a pointer to a mux and a target cache. It can roughly be summarized in the
 * following image:

 *
 * The primary entries that we care about are the overlay_dev_t, which
 * correspond to each overlay device that is created with dladm(1M). Globally,
 * these devices are maintained in a simple list_t which is protected with a
 * lock.  Hence, these include important information such as the mac_handle_t
 * and a datalink_id_t which is used to interact with the broader MAC and DLS
 * ecosystem. We also maintain additional information such as the current state,
 * outstanding operations, the mtu, and importantly, the plugin's private data.
 * This is the instance of an encapsulation plugin that gets created as part of
 * creating an overlay device. Another aspect of this is that the overlay_dev_t
 * also includes information with respect to FMA. For more information, see the
 * FMA section.
 *
 * Each overlay_dev_t has a pointer to a plugin, a mux, and a target. The plugin
 * is the encapsulation plugin. This allows the device to make downcalls into it
 * based on doing things like getting and setting properties. Otherwise, the
 * plugin itself is a fairly straightforward entity. They are maintained in an
 * (not pictured above) list. The plugins themselves mostly maintain things like
 * the static list of properties, what kind of destination they require, and the
 * operations vector. A given module may contain more if necessary.
 *
 * The next piece of the puzzle is the mux, or a multiplexor. The mux itself
 * maintains a ksocket and it is through the mux that we send and receive
 * message blocks. The mux represents a socket type and address, as well as a
 * plugin. Multiple overlay_dev_t devices may then share the same mux. For
 * example, consider the case where you have different instances of vxlan all on
 * the same underlay network. These would all logically share the same IP
 * address and port that packets are sent and received on; however, what differs
 * is the decapuslation ID.
 *
 * Each mux maintains a ksocket_t which is similar to a socket(3SOCKET). Unlike
 * a socket, we enable a direct callback on the ksocket. This means that
 * whenever a message block chain is received, rather than sitting there and
 * getting a callback in a context and kicking that back out to a taskq. Instead
 * data comes into the callback function overlay_mux_recv().
 *
 * The mux is given encapsulated packets (via overlay_m_tx, the GLDv3 tx
 * function) to transmit. It receives encapsulated packets, decapsulates them to
 * determine the overlay identifier, looks up the given device that matches that
 * identifier, and then causes the broader MAC world to receive the packet with
 * a call to mac_rx().
 *
 * Today, we don't do too much that's special with the ksocket; however, as
 * hardware is gaining understanding for these encapuslation protocols, we'll
 * probably want to think of better ways to get those capabilities passed down
 * and potentially better ways to program receive filters so they get directly
 * to us. Though, that's all fantasy future land.
 *
 * The next part of the puzzle is the target cache. The purpose of the target
 * cache is to cache where we should send a packet on the underlay network,
 * given its mac address. The target cache operates in two modes depending on
 * whether the lookup module was declared to OVERLAY_TARGET_POINT or
 * OVERLAY_TARGET_DYANMIC.
 *
 * In the case where the target cache has been programmed to be
 * OVERLAY_TARGET_POINT, then we only maintain a single overlay_target_point_t
 * which has the destination that we send everything, no matter the destination
 * mac address.
 *
 * On the other hand, when we have an instance of OVERLAY_TARGET_DYNAMIC, things
 * are much more interesting and as a result, more complicated. We primarily
 * store lists of overlay_target_entry_t's which are stored in both an avl tree
 * and a refhash_t. The primary look up path uses the refhash_t and the avl tree
 * is only used for a few of the target ioctls used to dump data such that we
 * can get a consistent iteration order for things like dladm show-overlay -t.
 * The key that we use for the reference hashtable is based on the mac address
 * in the cache and currently we just do a simple CRC32 to transform it into a
 * hash.
 *
 * Each entry maintains a set of flags to indicate the current status of the
 * request. The flags may indicate one of three states: that current cache entry
 * is valid, that the current cache entry has been directed to drop all output,
 * and that the current cache entry is invalid and may be being looked up. In
 * the case where it's valid, we just take the destination address and run with
 * it.
 *
 * If it's invalid and a lookup has not been made, then we start the process
 * that prepares a query that will make its way up to varpd. The cache entry
 * entry maintains a message block chain of outstanding message blocks and a
 * size. These lists are populated only when we don't know the answer as to
 * where should these be sent. The size entry is used to cap the amount of
 * outstanding data that we don't know the answer to. If we exceed a cap on the
 * amount of outstanding data (currently 1 Mb), then we'll drop any additional
 * packets. Once we get an answer indicating a valid destination, we transmit
 * any outstanding data to that place. For the full story on how we look that up
 * will be discussed in the section on the Target Cache Lifecycle.
 *
 * ------------------------
 * FMA and Degraded Devices
 * ------------------------
 *
 * Every kernel overlay device keeps track of its FMA state. Today in FMA we
 * cannot represent partitions between resources nor can we represent that a
 * given minor node of a psuedo device has failed -- if we degrade the overlay
 * device, then the entire dev_info_t is degraded. However, we still want to be
 * able to indicate to administrators that things may go wrong.
 *
 * To this end, we've added a notion of a degraded state to every overlay
 * device. This state is primarily dictated by userland and it can happen for
 * various reasons. Generally, because a userland lookup plugin has been
 * partitioned, or something has gone wrong such that there is no longer any
 * userland lookup module for a device, then we'll mark it degraded.
 *
 * As long as any of our minor instances is degraded, then we'll fire off the
 * FMA event to note that. Once the last degraded instance is no longer
 * degraded, then we'll end up telling FMA that we're all clean.
 *
 * To help administrators get a better sense of which of the various minor
 * devices is wrong, we store the odd_fmamsg[] character array. This character
 * array can be fetched with doing a dladm show-overlay -f.
 *
 * Note, that it's important that we do not update the link status of the
 * devices. We want to remain up as much as possible. By changing the link in a
 * degraded state, this may end up making things worse. We may still actually
 * have information in the target cache and if we mark the link down, that'll
 * result in not being able to use it. The reason being that this'll mark all
 * the downstream VNICs down which will go to IP and from there we end up
 * dealing with sadness.
 *
 * -----------------------
 * Target Cache Life Cycle
 * -----------------------
 *
 * This section only applies when we have a lookup plugin of
 * OVERLAY_TARGET_DYNAMIC. None of this applies to those of type
 * OVERLAY_TARGET_POINT.
 *
 * While we got into the target cache in the general architecture section, it's
 * worth going into more details as to how this actually works and showing some
 * examples and state machines. Recall that a target cache entry basically has
 * the following state transition diagram:
 *
 * Initial state
 *    . . .           . . . first access       . . . varpd lookup enqueued
 *        .           .                        .
 *        .           .                        .
 *     +-------+      .     +----------+       .
 *     |  No   |------*---->| Invalid  |-------*----+
 *     | Entry |            |  Entry   |            |
 *     +-------+            +----------+            |
 *                 varpd      ^      ^   varpd      |
 *                 invalidate |      |   drop       |
 *                      . . . *      * . .          v
 *          +-------+         |      |         +---------+
 *          | Entry |--->-----+      +----<----| Entry   |
 *          | Valid |<----------*---------<----| Pending |->-+     varpd
 *          +-------+           .              +---------+   * . . drop, but
 *                              . varpd                ^     |     other queued
 *                              . success              |     |     entries
 *                                                     +-----+
 *
 * When the table is first created, it is empty. As we attempt to lookup entries
 * and we find there is no entry at all, we'll create a new table entry for it.
 * At that point the entry is technically in an invalid state, that means that
 * we have no valid data from varpd. In that case, we'll go ahead and queue the
 * packet into the entry's pending chain, and queue a varpd lookup, setting the
 * OVERLAY_ENTRY_F_PENDING flag in the progress.
 *
 * If additional mblk_t's come in for this entry, we end up appending them to
 * the tail of the chain, if and only if, we don't exceed the threshold for the
 * amount of space they can take up. An entry remains pending until we get a
 * varpd reply. If varpd replies with a valid results, we move to the valid
 * entry state, and remove the OVERLAY_ENTRY_F_PENDING flag and set it with one
 * of OVERLAY_ENTRY_F_VALID or OVERLAY_ENTRY_F_DROP as appropriate.
 *
 * Once an entry is valid, it stays valid until user land tells us to invalidate
 * it with an ioctl or replace it, OVERLAY_TARG_CACHE_REMOE and
 * OVERLAY_TARG_CACHE_SET respectively.
 *
 * If the lookup fails with a call to drop the packet, then the next state is
 * determined by the state of the queue. If the set of outstanding entries is
 * empty, then we just transition back to the invalid state. If instead, the
 * set of outstanding entries is not empty, then we'll queue another entry and
 * stay in the same state, repeating this until the number of requests is
 * drained.
 *
 * The following images describes the flow of a given lookup and where the
 * overlay_target_entry_t is at any given time.

 *     | Valid Entry       |		varpd returned an answer with
 *     | de:ad:be:ef:00:00 |		OVERLAY_IOC_RESPOND and the target cache
 *     | 10.169.23.42:4789 |		entry is now populated with a
 *     +-------------------+		destination and marked as valid
 *
 *
 * The lookup mechanism is performed via a series of operations on the character
 * psuedo-device /dev/overlay. The only thing that uses this device is the
 * userland daemon varpd. /dev/overlay is a cloneable device, each open of it
 * granting a new minor number which maintains its own state. We maintain this
 * state so that way if an outstanding lookup was queued to something that
 * crashed or closed its handle without responding, we can know about this and
 * thus handle it appropriately.
 *
 * When a lookup is first created it's added to our global list of outstanding
 * lookups. To service requests, userland is required to perform an ioctl to ask
 * for a request. We will block it in the kernel a set amount of time waiting
 * for a request. When we give a request to a given minor instance of the
 * device, we remove it from the global list and append the request to the
 * device's list of outstanding entries, for the reasons we discussed above.
 * When a lookup comes in, we give user land a smaller amount of information
 * specific to that packet, the overlay_targ_lookup_t. It includes a request id
 * to identify this, and then the overlay id, the varpd id, the header and
 * packet size, the source and destination mac address, the SAP, and any
 * potential VLAN header.
 *
 * At that point, it stays in that outstanding list until one of two ioctls are
 * returned: OVERLAY_TARG_RESPOND or OVERLAY_TARG_DROP. During this time,
 * userland may also perform other operations. For example, it may use
 * OVERLAY_TARG_PKT to get a copy of this packet so it can perform more in-depth
 * analysis of what to do beyond what we gave it initially. This is useful for
 * providing proxy arp and the like. Finally, there are two other ioctls that
 * varpd can then do. The first is OVERLAY_TARG_INJECT which injects the
 * non-jumbo frame packet up into that mac device and OVERLAY_TARG_RESEND which
 * causes us to encapsulate and send out the packet they've given us.
 *
 *
 * Finally, through the target cache, several ioctls are provided to allow for
 * interrogation and management of the cache. They allow for individual entries
 * to be retrieved, set, or have the entire table flushed. For the full set of
 * ioctls here and what they do, take a look at uts/common/sys/overlay_target.h.
 *
 * ------------------
 * Sample Packet Flow
 * ------------------
 *
 * There's a lot of pieces here, hopefully an example of how this all fits
 * together will help clarify and elucidate what's going on. We're going to
 * first track an outgoing packet, eg. one that is sent from an IP interface on
 * a VNIC on top of an overlay device, and then we'll look at what it means to
 * respond to that.

 * ------------------
 * Netstack Awareness
 * ------------------
 *
 * In the above image we note that this enters a netstack. Today the only
 * netstack that can be is the global zone as the overlay driver itself is not
 * exactly netstack aware. What this really means is that varpd cannot run in a
 * non-global zone and an overlay device cannot belong to a non-global zone.
 * Non-global zones can still have a VNIC assigned to them that's been created
 * over the overlay device the same way they would if it had been created over
 * an etherstub or a physical device.
 *
 * The majority of the work to make it netstack aware is straightforward and the
 * biggest thing is to create a netstack module that allows us to hook into
 * netstack (and thus zone) creation and destruction.  From there, we need to
 * amend the target cache lookup routines that we discussed earlier to not have
 * a global outstanding list and a global list of handles, but rather, one per
 * netstack.
 *
 * For the mux, we'll need to open the ksocket in the context of the zone, we
 * can likely do this with a properly composed credential, but we'll need to do
 * some more work on that path. Finally, we'll want to make sure the dld ioctls
 * are aware of the zoneid of the caller and we use that appropriately and store
 * it in the overlay_dev_t.
 *
 * -----------
 * GLDv3 Notes
 * -----------
 *
 * The overlay driver implements a GLDv3 device. Parts of GLDv3 are more
 * relevant and other parts are much less relevant for us. For example, the
 * GLDv3 is used to toggle the device being put into and out of promiscuous
 * mode, to program MAC addresses for unicast and multicast hardware filters.
 * Today, an overlay device doesn't have a notion of promiscuous mode nor does
 * it have a notion of unicast and multicast addresses programmed into the
 * device. Instead, for the purposes of the hardware filter, we don't do
 * anything and just always accept new addresses being added and removed.
 *
 * If the GLDv3 start function has not been called, then we will not use this
 * device for I/O purposes. Any calls to transmit or receive should be dropped,
 * though the GLDv3 guarantees us that transmit will not be called without
 * calling start. Similarly, once stop is called, then no packets can be dealt
 * with.
 *
 * Today we don't support the stat interfaces, though there's no good reason
 * that we shouldn't assemble some of the stats based on what we have in the
 * future.
 *
 * When it comes to link properties, many of the traditional link properties do
 * not apply and many others MAC handles for us. For example, we don't need to
 * implement anything for overlay_m_getprop() to deal with returning the MTU, as
 * MAC never calls into us for that. As such, there isn't much of anything to
 * support in terms of properties.
 *
 * Today, we don't support any notion of hardware capabilities. However, if
 * future NIC hardware or other changes to the system cause it to make sense for
 * us to emulate logical groups, then we should do that. However, we still do
 * implement a capab function so that we can identify ourselves as an overlay
 * device to the broader MAC framework. This is done mostly so that a device
 * created on top of us can have fanout rings as we don't try to lie about a
 * speed for our device.
 *
 * The other question is what should be done for a device's MTU and margin. We
 * set our minimum supported MTU to be the minimum value that an IP network may
 * be set to 576 -- which mimics what an etherstub does. On the flip side, we
 * have our upper bound set to 8900. This value comes from the fact that a lot
 * of jumbo networks use their maximum as 9000. As such, we want to reserve 100
 * bytes, which isn't exactly the most accurate number, but it'll be good enough
 * for now. Because of that, our default MTU off of these devices is 1400, as
 * the default MTU for everything is usually 1500 or whatever the underlying
 * device is at; however, this is a bit simpler than asking the netstack what
 * are all the IP interfaces at. It also calls into question how PMTU and PMTU
 * discovery should work here. The challenge, especially for
 * OVERLAY_TARG_DYNAMIC is that the MTU to any of the places will vary and it's
 * not clear that if you have a single bad entry that the overall MTU should be
 * lowered. Instead, we should figure out a better way of determining these
 * kinds of PMTU errors and appropriately alerting the administrator via FMA.
 *
 * Regarding margin, we allow a margin of up to VLAN_TAGSZ depending on whether
 * or not the underlying encapsulation device supports VLAN tags. If it does,
 * then we'll set the margin to allow for it, otherwise, we will not.
