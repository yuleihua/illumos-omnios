# Prerequisites
#
# The uts/Makefile defines build parallelism for sun4 platforms such that sparc,
# sun4u and sun4v are all built in parallel. Also this Makefile specifies that
# all IMPLEMENTATIONS sun4u sub-platforms are built in parallel. This requires
# building certain parts before the parallel build can start. The uts/Makefile
# appends the '.prereq' string to the original target and executes this Makefile
# to build any prerequisites needed before the full parallel build can start.
# After that make continues with normal targets.
#
# Any build prerequisites for sun4 and IMPLEMENTATIONS builds should be
# described here.
#
# genassym is used to build dtrace and genunix, so it should be built first.
#
# priv_const.c is required to build genunix.
#
# genunix is used by everyone to ctfmerge with. Genunix is merged with sparc/ip
#   so as a side effect this dependency builds sparc/ip as part of the
#   prerequisites.
#
# unix is not required by itself but several sun4u platforms require
#   sun4u/platmod to be present. The easiest way to achieve this is to build
#   sun4u/unix first since sun4u/unix Makefile builds sun4u/platform correctly.
#   This causes full sun4u/unix to be built before all sun4u platforms and
#   before uts/sun4v and uts/sparc, but it acceptable since it is not spending
#   too much time building sun4u/unix.
#
