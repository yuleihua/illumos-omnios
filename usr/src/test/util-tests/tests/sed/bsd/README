The tests in this directory were imported from the sed tests in FreeBSD
( https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/tree/master/usr.bin/sed/tests )
and adjusted as necessary for the illumos environment.

Changes included:

 * Switched to /bin/ksh
 * Added more error checking
 * Create all temporary files in a temporary /tmp directory
 * Add escapes to echo commands where a backslash was present
