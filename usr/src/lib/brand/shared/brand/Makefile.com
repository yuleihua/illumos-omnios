# Ugh, this is a gross hack.  Our assembly routines uses lots of defines
# to simplify variable access.  All these defines work fine for amd64
# compiles because when compiling for amd64 we use the GNU assembler,
# gas.  For 32-bit code we use the Sun assembler, as.  Unfortunatly
# as does not handle certian constructs that gas does.  So rather than
# make our code less readable, we'll just use gas to compile our 32-bit
# code as well.
