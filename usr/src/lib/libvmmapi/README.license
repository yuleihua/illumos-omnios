Having been ported from FreeBSD, bhyve bears the BSD license.  Subsequent
changes made to bhyve in illumos are dual-licensed under both the BSD license
and the CDDL.  Use or redistribution of those subsequent changes may be done
under either license. The CDDL license header added to bhyve source files is
meant to cover only those dual-licensed modifications, not the entire file.
