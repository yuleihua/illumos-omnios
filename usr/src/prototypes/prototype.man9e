.Sh DESCRIPTION
.\" This should include a description of the entry point. This includes
.\" information such as what framework it is a part of. What it is
.\" expected to actually do. Any constraints on what it should validate.
.\" Any concerns around locking or callbacks into the broader
.\" frameworks. Whether it can be called in parallel by multiple
.\" threads, etc.
.Sh CONTEXT
.\" Indicates the context in which this framework function is called.
.\" Generally this is one or more of:
.\" .Sy user
.\" .Sy kernel
.\" .Sy interrupt
.\" However sometimes there may be something specific. Such as this is
.\" only called or used during attach or detach.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.\" This should indicate what the driver should return on successful
.\" completion and what it should have done. Otherwise it should
.\" indicate the class of error returned.
.Sh ERRORS
.\" This should be a list of recommended errors and causes. If the
.\" interface only supports returning DDI_SUCCESS or DDI_FAILURE,
.\" then this section should not be used. If it should only return these
.\" specific errors and this section shouldn't be used as a guide,
.\" indicate that.
