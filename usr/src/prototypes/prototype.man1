.Dt COMMAND 1
.\" Here and in other places "COMMAND" and "command" are place holders
.\" that should be replaced with the name of the actual command that
.\" this is documenting.
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm command
.Nd short description
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.\" Each of the following lines should use the Fl and Ar options to
.\" indicate the set of supported options and flags. There should be one
.\" option and argument per line. If there are independent ways of
.\" invoking the command or independent sub-commands ala zfs(1M) or
.\" dladm(1M), there should be a fresh '.Nm' to indicate that and the
.\" sub-command should use .Cm.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.\" Describe the purpose of the utility, what it does and how it
.\" operates. If there are certain privileges or other considerations
.\" for using this, indicate that here.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Fl flag1
Description of the above flag1
.It Fl flag2
Description of the above flag2
.El
.Sh OPERANDS
.\" This should be a list of non-flag arguments that are supported
.\" and what they do in the following form.
The following operands are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Ar oper1
Description of what oper1 is.
.It Ar oper2
Description of what oper2 is.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.\" This section should indicate the set of exit codes one can expect.
.\" In general, do not use the '.Ex' macro and instead call out the
.\" different error values. One would expect at least a difference
.\" between an error during execution and an error in the usage.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.\" There should be multiple examples present that describe how to use
.\" different parts of the command. This section should not be skipped
.\" and it's good to have a number of them.
.\" .Sh ENVIRONMENT
.\" If the program reacts to environment variables, most often locale
.\" related ones, document those here. If they are just the standard
.\" locale ones, use the following text, adjusting it for the exact set
.\" of locale specific values that impact it:
.\" See
.\" .Xr environ 5
.\" for descriptions of the following environment variables
.\" that affect the execution of
.\" .Nm :
.\" .Ev LANG ,
.\" .Ev LC_ALL ,
.\" .Ev LC_MESSAGES ,
.\" .Ev LC_NUMERIC ,
.\" and
.\" .Ev NLSPATH .
.\" .Sh CODE SET INDEPENDENCE
.\" If there are issues around the code set, indicate so here. See
.\" attributes(5).
.Sh INTERFACE STABILITY
.\" When documenting the stability of commands it's useful to
.\" distinguish between the stability of the options and the command's
.\" actual output. For most commands, output stability should only be
.\" guaranteed if there's an explicit parseable option that controls the
.\" type of data. You can use the following template:
.\" The command line interface of
.\" .Nm
.\" is
.\" .Sy Committed .
.\" .Sy Evolving .
.\" .Sy Volatile .
.\" .Sy Private .
.\" The output of
.\" .Nm
.\" is
.\" .Sy Not-An-Interface
.\" and may change at any time.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.\" List other commands that are related to this. For programs that are
.\" are primarily wrappers around libc functionality or a particular
.\" library, it's helpful to mention those here so the reader has an
.\" idea of what is used to implement this. For example, the sleep
.\" command would mention nanosleep(3C).
